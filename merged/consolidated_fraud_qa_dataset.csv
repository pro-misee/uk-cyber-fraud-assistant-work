"I'm not sure if I should report the crime to the police, what should I consider?",,"It's completely normal to feel unsure about reporting a crime to the police. You might worry that the police won't care, or that reporting will make things worse. Maybe you've had a bad experience with the police in the past. These concerns are valid, but there are positive reasons to consider reporting. Reporting increases the chance that the offender will be caught or brought to justice. The police keep records of all reported crime, which helps with government statistics and can influence how crime is dealt with. If you do report, you have a right to be referred to victim support services. The police should tell you about all available support in your local area. Remember that Victim Support will help you whether you decide to involve the police or not. You can contact them on 08 08 16 89 111 for confidential advice about your options.

I just got a call from someone claiming to be from the FCA asking for my bank details and PIN. They sounded very official and knew some of my information. Should I give them what they want?,,"No, absolutely not! The FCA would never ask you for your bank account PINs, passwords, or ask you to transfer money to them. This is a classic scam where fraudsters pretend to be from legitimate organisations. Even if they know some of your details, this doesn't make them genuine - scammers often have access to leaked data. Hang up immediately and report this to the FCA on 0800 111 6768. You should also contact your bank using the number on the back of your card to alert them about this suspicious call. Remember, legitimate organisations will never pressure you to act quickly or ask for sensitive financial information over the phone.",FCA scam protection guidance - fake FCA communications warning,https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/protect-yourself-scams,1,1,gemini
Someone contacted me out of the blue offering an investment opportunity with guaranteed high returns. They're pressuring me to decide quickly. Is this legitimate?,,"This has all the classic warning signs of a scam. Legitimate investments don't offer guaranteed high returns, and genuine financial firms won't pressure you to act quickly. The fact that they contacted you unexpectedly ('out of the blue') is a major red flag. Before considering any investment, use the FCA Firm Checker to verify if the firm is authorised. Check that the firm reference number and contact details match what's on the official register. If you can't find them on the Firm Checker, call the FCA on 0800 111 6768. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

I paid money for a loan but never received it. The company asked for an upfront fee of £300 and said it was refundable. What should I do?,,"You've likely fallen victim to loan fee fraud, which is a common scam where victims lose an average of £255. Legitimate lenders don't ask for upfront fees before providing loans. If you've already paid money, contact your bank immediately using the number on your card or statements to try to recover the funds. Report this scam to the FCA on 0800 111 6768. For future reference, only deal with authorised financial firms - use the FCA Firm Checker to verify if a company is legitimate before giving them any money.

I'm under 55 but someone offered to help me access my pension early. They said it's called 'pension liberation' and I can borrow from my pension fund. Should I do this?,,"No, this is almost certainly a scam. You can only take money from your pension when you're 55 or older (increasing to 57 from 2028), except in very specific cases like poor health. Early pension release schemes are illegal and could result in a 55% tax bill on what you withdraw, even if you didn't realise you were breaking the rules. These scams often transfer your pension to schemes based abroad, take hefty fees (up to 30%), and sometimes simply steal your money outright. If you're worried about money and considering using your pension to repay debts, contact a free debt adviser first using MoneyHelper's debt advice locator tool. Never take advice from the company that contacted you - this may be part of the scam.",FCA pension scams guidance - early pension release,https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/pension-scams,1,2,gemini
Someone contacted me offering a free pension review. They said they're acting on behalf of the FCA. Is this legitimate?,,"No, this is likely a scam. Professional pension advice is not free, and most companies offering free pension reviews aren't authorised by the FCA. Scammers often falsely claim they're acting on behalf of the FCA or MoneyHelper. These 'free' reviews are designed to persuade you to move your pension into high-risk schemes involving unusual investments like overseas property, forestry, or storage units. If you get a cold call about your pension, the safest thing to do is hang up immediately - it's illegal and probably a scam. Report pension cold calls to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). If you're thinking about changing your pension arrangements, get proper financial guidance or advice from an FCA-authorised adviser first.",FCA pension scams guidance - pension review scams,https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/pension-scams,1,2,gemini
I received an email asking me to download screen sharing software to help with an investment opportunity. Should I do this?,,"Absolutely not! This is a screen sharing scam. Once you download the software and allow them access to your screen, scammers can access your personal information and financial accounts, including your online banking. Even if you've searched for a company online and contacted them, you should never share your screen with them. Scammers may try to build trust or friendship to put you at ease, but this is all part of their deception. If you're asked to share your screen or provide remote access to your phone or computer, this is a major warning sign it's a scam. Only deal with financial services firms that are authorised by the FCA - use the FCA Firm Checker to verify if a firm is legitimate before having any contact with them.",FCA screen sharing scams guidance,https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/screen-sharing-scams,1,7,gemini
How can I tell if an investment opportunity is legitimate?,,"Always use the FCA Firm Checker to verify if a financial firm is authorised and has permission for the service they're offering. Check that the firm reference number (FRN) and contact details match what's on the official register. If there are no contact details on the Firm Checker, or the firm says they're out of date, call the FCA on 0800 111 6768. Be very wary of unexpected contact, pressure to invest quickly, or promises of guaranteed high returns. If you're contacted about an investment opportunity unexpectedly, use the FCA's Investment Checker to avoid scams.

I've been scammed before and now someone is offering to help me get my money back for a fee. Should I trust them?,,"No, this is likely a recovery room scam. Fraudsters often target people who have already been scammed, either by trying to scam them again or by selling their details to other criminals. These follow-up scams might offer to get your money back or buy back an investment after you pay a fee. If you've already been scammed, it's important to be extra careful as fraudsters could try to target you again. The new scam might be completely different or related to the previous one. If you have any concerns about a potential financial scam, contact the FCA immediately on 0800 111 6768.

Call them on 0800 111 6768 or use their contact form. If you've given scammers any personal information or made a payment, contact your bank immediately using the number on your card or statements. The FCA can only look into scams involving financial services they regulate.

I feel embarrassed about falling for a scam. Is this normal and how do I cope?,,"It's completely normal to feel embarrassed, but you shouldn't be ashamed. Scammers are sophisticated and can be very convincing, even to intelligent people. They use psychological tactics to pressure and manipulate victims. Many people fall for scams, and it's not a reflection of your intelligence or character. The important thing is to report it to help prevent others from being targeted. Contact the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if it's a financial scam, or Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 for other types of fraud. If you're struggling with the emotional impact, consider talking to a trusted friend or family member, or seek support from organisations like Victim Support. Remember, you're not alone - scammers target thousands of people every year, and reporting helps authorities catch them and protect others.",FCA scam protection guidance - victim support,https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/protect-yourself-scams,1,1,gemini
Someone is offering me an investment in overseas property development with guaranteed returns. They said it's not regulated by the FCA but that's normal. Should I invest?,,"Be extremely cautious. Investment scams often involve unregulated products, and overseas property development is commonly used by scammers. Even if the offer isn't a scam, investing in unregulated products means you won't be protected if something goes wrong and you could lose all your money. The FCA lists many unregulated investment types including overseas property, forestry, storage units, care homes, and various commodities. If you're contacted unexpectedly about an investment opportunity, use the FCA's Investment Checker to avoid scams. Always verify the firm using the FCA Firm Checker, and be suspicious of guaranteed returns - legitimate investments don't offer guarantees. Consider getting independent financial advice before making any investment decisions, especially for unregulated products.",FCA scam protection guidance - unregulated investment scams,https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/protect-yourself-scams,1,1,gemini
How do I check if a financial firm is legitimate before dealing with them?,,"Use the FCA Firm Checker to verify if a financial firm is authorised and has permission for the service they're offering. Check that the firm reference number (FRN) and contact details match what's on the official register. Always use the contact details on the Firm Checker rather than direct lines or emails you've been given. If there are no contact details on the Firm Checker, or the firm says they're out of date, call the FCA on 0800 111 6768. Remember that some firms pretend to be authorised firms, so always use the official contact details. Never click on links in emails or on company websites to visit the Firm Checker - always use the official website address.

I received a text message saying I've won a prize and need to pay a fee to claim it. Is this legitimate?,,"No, this is a scam. Legitimate competitions and prizes don't require you to pay fees to claim them. This is a common tactic used by fraudsters to trick people into sending money. If you're contacted unexpectedly about winning a prize, competition, or lottery, it's almost certainly a scam. The FCA can't help with competition or lottery scams as they don't involve financial services they regulate. Instead, report this to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or via their website. If you live in Scotland, report to Police Scotland on 101 or contact Advice Direct Scotland on 0808 164 6000.

What are the warning signs that I might be dealing with a scammer?,,"There are several key warning signs to watch out for: unexpected contact (calls, emails, texts out of the blue), pressure to act quickly, offers that sound too good to be true, claims that you've been specially chosen for an exclusive opportunity, attempts to flatter you or build friendship, emotional manipulation (making you feel worried or excited), and claims of authority or special knowledge. Scammers often use sophisticated tactics and can appear very convincing. If you're contacted unexpectedly or feel suspicious about any communication, stop and check these warning signs. If you answer 'yes' to any of these questions, or you're unsure if a contact is genuine, use the FCA Firm Checker to verify the company and contact the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if you have concerns. Remember, legitimate businesses won't pressure you to make quick decisions.",FCA scam protection guidance - warning signs,https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/protect-yourself-scams,1,1,gemini
I'm struggling with debt and someone offered me a loan with no credit checks. They want me to pay a fee first. Should I trust them?,,"No, this is likely loan fee fraud. Legitimate lenders don't offer 'no credit check' loans, and they don't ask for upfront fees before providing loans. This scam targets people who are struggling financially and may have been turned down by legitimate lenders. The fraudsters often ask for between £25 and £450 as a deposit, administrative fee, or insurance, but you'll never receive the loan. If you're struggling with debt, don't fall for these scams - instead, get free debt advice from MoneyHelper. You can use their Debt Advice Locator tool to find free services in your area.

What should I do if I receive a suspicious phone call?,,"If you receive a suspicious phone call, the safest thing to do is hang up immediately. Don't engage with the caller or try to argue with them. If they claim to be from your bank, the police, or another organization, don't trust them - hang up and call the organization back using a number you know is genuine (like the number on the back of your bank card or from their official website). Wait at least 5 minutes before calling back, as fraudsters can stay on the line after you hang up. If you're unsure about a call, you can report scam call numbers by texting 7726 with the word 'Call' followed by the scam caller's number. Your phone provider can investigate and block malicious numbers. If you've lost money or been hacked as a result of responding to a call, report it to Action Fraud online or by calling 0300 123 2040.

Check the website address carefully - scammers often use addresses that look similar to legitimate sites but have slight differences. Look for the padlock symbol and 'https' in the address bar, though these aren't guarantees of legitimacy. Be suspicious of websites with poor design, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors. Check for contact information and physical addresses - legitimate businesses usually provide these. Be wary of websites offering products at prices that seem too good to be true. Check online reviews and search for complaints about the website. If you're unsure about a website, you can report it to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) through Action Fraud's website.

Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts and enable two-factor authentication where possible. Check your bank statements and credit reports regularly for any unusual activity. If you move house, set up mail redirection with Royal Mail to prevent your post from falling into the wrong hands. Be wary of unsolicited requests for personal information via phone, email, or text. If you're expecting important documents like bank statements and they don't arrive, contact the sender immediately. Consider signing up for CIFAS protective registration, which adds extra checks when financial services are applied for using your details.

How can I tell if an investment opportunity is legitimate?,,"Be extremely cautious of investment opportunities, especially those offered out of the blue. Check if the firm is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) by searching the FCA Register. Be suspicious of promises of high returns with low risk - if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Legitimate investment firms won't pressure you to act quickly or make you feel like you're missing out on a limited-time opportunity. Be wary of investments in unusual assets like overseas property, renewable energy bonds, or storage units, especially if they're unregulated. Check the FCA Warning List to see if the firm is known to be operating without authorization. Be cautious of complex investment structures where it's unclear where your money will end up. If you're unsure, seek independent financial advice from an FCA-authorized adviser.

If the person who gave you the counterfeit notes is still present or nearby, consider calling the police on 999. If they're not present, report it to your local police by calling 101, attending your local police station, or reporting online depending on your force area. Keep the counterfeit notes as evidence, ideally in a plastic wallet or paper envelope to preserve any fingerprints. If you have CCTV footage of the person who gave you the counterfeit currency, download it and provide it to the police along with the notes. Don't handle the notes more than necessary to preserve evidence. You can check if notes are genuine by looking for security features - the Bank of England website has detailed guidance on how to check banknotes.

Check the ATM for any signs of tampering or unusual devices before using it. If the machine looks suspicious or has been tampered with, don't use it and report it to the bank immediately. Put your personal safety first - if someone makes you feel uncomfortable, cancel the transaction and leave. Once you've completed a transaction, put your money and card away before leaving the ATM.

What should I do if I receive a suspicious email from the NCA or police?,,"If you receive an email claiming to be from the National Crime Agency (NCA) or police, be very suspicious.

Cheques should clear with money in your account after the sixth working day, but nothing is guaranteed before that.

How long does it take to investigate a fraud case?,,"Fraud investigations can take weeks, months, or even years depending on the complexity of the case and the resources available. Simple cases might be resolved quickly, while complex international scams can take much longer. The police and Action Fraud prioritise cases based on factors like the amount of money involved and the likelihood of recovery. While you wait, continue monitoring your accounts for suspicious activity and keep all evidence safe. Don't expect regular updates - fraud units are often understaffed and dealing with thousands of cases. Focus on protecting yourself from further scams and consider the money lost as a lesson learned. Unfortunately, many fraud cases are never solved, but reporting still helps build intelligence and protect others.",Get Safe Online - Fraud investigation guidance,https://www.getsafeonline.org/protecting-yourself/,1,1,gemini
I received a call from someone claiming to be from my bank asking for my PIN number. They knew some of my details already. Should I have given it to them?,,"No, you should never give your PIN to anyone, even if they claim to be from your bank. Legitimate banks will never ask for your PIN, full password, or card details over the phone. The fact that they knew some of your details doesn't make them genuine - scammers often have access to leaked data or use social engineering to gather information. You did the right thing by being cautious. I'd recommend contacting your bank directly using the number on the back of your card to report this incident. You should also report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. If you did share any information, contact your bank immediately to secure your account. Remember, it's always better to hang up and call back on a verified number if you're unsure about any call.",Get Safe Online - Banking security guidance,https://www.getsafeonline.org/protecting-yourself/,1,1,gemini
How can I tell if a website is legitimate before making a purchase?,,"Look for the padlock symbol and 'https://' in the website address, which indicates a secure connection. Check the website's contact details and physical address. Read customer reviews from multiple sources, not just the website itself. Be suspicious of websites with poor grammar, spelling mistakes, or that offer products at unrealistically low prices. Check if the company is registered with Companies House. Look for trust marks from organisations like Which? or the British Retail Consortium. Never pay by bank transfer to unknown sellers - use credit cards or PayPal which offer buyer protection. If you're unsure, search for the company name plus 'scam' or 'review' to see what others say. Trust your instincts - if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.",Get Safe Online - Online shopping safety,https://www.getsafeonline.org/protecting-yourself/,1,1,gemini
What should I do if I think my computer has been infected with malware?,,"If you suspect malware infection, disconnect your computer from the internet immediately to prevent further damage. Run a full scan with your antivirus software and update it if necessary. If you don't have antivirus software, download a reputable program. Check for any suspicious programs in your control panel and uninstall them. Change all your passwords from a different device, starting with email and banking accounts. Monitor your bank statements for unusual activity. If you're not confident dealing with this yourself, consider taking your computer to a reputable repair shop. Be aware of 'tech support' scams where fraudsters claim to help fix your computer for a fee.

Consider registering with CIFAS for protective registration, which adds a warning to your credit file. Monitor your bank statements and credit reports regularly. Report any suspicious activity to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. Consider using a credit monitoring service to alert you to changes in your credit file.

How do I protect my children from online scams?,,"Talk to your children about online safety and the risks of sharing personal information. Set up parental controls on devices and monitor their online activity. Teach them to be suspicious of offers that seem too good to be true, especially free games or prizes. Warn them about sharing personal information like their name, address, or school online. Monitor their social media accounts and friend lists. Set up separate user accounts on shared computers with limited permissions. Use age-appropriate privacy settings on gaming consoles and apps. Encourage them to tell you about any suspicious messages or requests they receive. Consider using family safety apps that allow you to monitor and control their online activity.

Someone is threatening to share my private photos unless I pay them money. What should I do?,,"This is a form of blackmail called 'sextortion' or 'webcam blackmail'. Do not pay the money - this will only encourage them to demand more. Stop all communication with the blackmailer immediately. Take screenshots of all messages and threats for evidence. Report this to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 and to your local police. If the photos involve someone under 18, report to the Internet Watch Foundation. Contact the platform where the blackmailer contacted you to report the account. Remember, paying rarely stops the threats and often makes them worse. Most blackmailers move on to other victims when they realise you won't pay. Focus on protecting yourself and reporting the crime rather than giving in to threats.",Get Safe Online - Webcam blackmail guidance,https://www.getsafeonline.org/protecting-yourself/,1,1,gemini
I think I've been targeted by a pyramid scheme. How can I tell?,,"Pyramid schemes typically promise high returns for recruiting others rather than selling actual products or services. Warning signs include being asked to pay money upfront to join, pressure to recruit friends and family, promises of quick wealth, and complex commission structures based on recruitment. The focus is usually on getting more people to join rather than selling legitimate products. If you're being pressured to recruit others to make money, this is likely a pyramid scheme. Report suspected pyramid schemes to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 and to the Financial Conduct Authority. Remember, legitimate businesses make money from selling products or services, not from recruiting more participants. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.",Get Safe Online - Pyramid schemes guidance,https://www.getsafeonline.org/protecting-yourself/,1,1,gemini
I received an email claiming to be from HMRC about a tax refund. Is this legitimate?,,"HMRC will never contact you by email about tax refunds. This is a common phishing scam. HMRC only contacts people by post for tax matters. If you receive an email claiming to be from HMRC about refunds, delete it immediately. Do not click on any links or provide any personal information. If you're expecting a tax refund, you'll receive a letter in the post. You can check your tax position by logging into your personal tax account on the official HMRC website. Report suspicious HMRC emails to phishing@hmrc.gov.uk.

Check your privacy settings and limit who can see your posts. Be suspicious of friend requests from people you don't know, especially if they have few friends or posts. Don't click on links in messages from unknown users. Be wary of posts offering free products, prizes, or investment opportunities. Never share personal information like your address, phone number, or financial details. Be careful about posting holiday photos while you're away - this tells burglars your home is empty.

Should I call the number?,,"No, do not call the number in the text message. This is a common scam tactic.

You can also forward suspicious text messages to your mobile network provider by sending them to 7726 (which spells 'SPAM' on your keypad). This helps them identify and block scam messages.

What should I do if I think someone I know is being targeted by scammers?,,"If you think someone you know is being targeted by scammers, approach the situation sensitively but act quickly. Express your concern without being judgmental - remember that scammers are very convincing and anyone can be vulnerable. Share information about common scam tactics and the Take Five campaign principles. Help them verify any suspicious requests by contacting the organisation directly using official contact details. If they've already lost money or shared personal information, encourage them to contact their bank immediately and report to Action Fraud. Offer to help them make these calls if they're feeling overwhelmed. If they're elderly or vulnerable, consider contacting their bank on their behalf with their permission. You might also want to contact Adult Social Services if you're concerned about their ability to protect themselves. The key is to be supportive while helping them take immediate action to protect themselves.",UK Finance fraud prevention and vulnerable customer support,https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/our-expertise/personal-banking/consumer-protection,1,6,gemini
How long does it typically take to recover money lost to scams?,,"The time it takes to recover money lost to scams varies significantly depending on the circumstances. If you act quickly and contact your bank immediately, they may be able to stop or reverse transactions, especially if the money hasn't been transferred yet. Some banks have fraud protection schemes that may reimburse victims of certain types of scams, though this isn't guaranteed. The recovery process can take weeks or months, and in many cases, especially with international scams, the money may not be recoverable at all. This is why it's crucial to act immediately when you suspect you've been scammed. The sooner you report it, the better chance you have of recovering your money. Your bank will guide you through their specific process, and you should also report the incident to Action Fraud. Remember that prevention is always better than trying to recover lost money, which is why it's so important to be vigilant and follow the Take Five campaign advice.",UK Finance fraud recovery and victim support guidance,https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/fraud-and-scams,1,5,gemini
What are the most common types of financial scams I should be aware of?,,"The most common types of financial scams include impersonation scams where criminals pretend to be from your bank, the police, or government agencies. Investment scams offer fake opportunities with high returns. Romance scams target people through dating sites or social media. Tech support scams involve fake computer problems. Lottery and prize scams claim you've won money but need to pay fees to claim it. Loan scams offer quick money but require upfront fees. Cryptocurrency scams promise high returns on digital currency investments. Phishing scams use fake emails or websites to steal personal information. Remote access scams trick you into giving criminals control of your computer. Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud involves tricking you into transferring money to fraudsters. The key is to be suspicious of any unsolicited contact, especially if it involves money, personal information, or urgent action. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.",UK Finance fraud awareness and scam prevention guidance,https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/our-expertise/economic-crime/fraud-scams,1,4,gemini
How can I check if my personal information has been compromised in a data breach?,,"To check if your personal information has been compromised in a data breach, you can use services like Have I Been Pwned, which allows you to check if your email address has appeared in known data breaches. You should also monitor your bank accounts and credit cards regularly for any suspicious activity. Check your credit report through agencies like Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion to see if any new accounts have been opened in your name. Be alert for unexpected bills, letters from debt collectors, or notices about accounts you didn't open. If you suspect your information has been compromised, contact your bank immediately and consider placing a fraud alert on your credit file. You may also want to change passwords for important accounts and enable two-factor authentication where possible. Remember that data breaches can happen to any organisation, so it's important to be vigilant about monitoring your accounts and personal information.",UK Finance cyber security and data protection guidance,https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/about-us/our-commitments/cyber-essentials,1,2,gemini
What should I do if I receive a suspicious phone call from someone claiming to be from my bank?,,"If you receive a suspicious phone call from someone claiming to be from your bank, be very cautious. Banks will never ask for your full password, PIN, or card details over the phone. They won't pressure you to act quickly or ask you to transfer money to 'safe accounts.' If you're unsure about the call, hang up and contact your bank directly using the number on the back of your card or from their official website. Don't use any phone numbers provided by the caller. Ask the caller for their name and department, then verify this information with your bank. Be suspicious of calls that create urgency or ask you to keep the call secret. Remember that scammers can spoof phone numbers to make it appear they're calling from your bank. If you've shared any information during the call, contact your bank immediately to secure your account.

If you're online, close the browser or app. If you've already lost money or provided sensitive information, contact your bank immediately to secure your accounts.

"Someone is pressuring me to pay money urgently, is this legitimate?",,"No, legitimate organisations will never pressure you to pay money urgently. This is a classic sign of a scam. Scammers create false urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly and checking if the request is genuine. If someone is demanding immediate payment, threatening you with legal action, or claiming you'll lose money if you don't act now, it's almost certainly a scam. Hang up the phone, delete the email, or close the conversation immediately. If you're unsure, contact the organisation directly using contact details you find independently (not from the message you received). Remember, your bank, the police, government departments, and legitimate companies will never pressure you to make immediate payments or threaten you with consequences for not acting quickly.",Action Fraud scam identification and prevention guidance,https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/report-phishing,1,2,gemini

If you've shared personal information like passwords, change them immediately, especially for your email and banking accounts.

The NCSC will investigate the email and may block malicious addresses or remove links to scam websites. While they can't tell you the outcome of their review, they do act on every message received.

"Someone claiming to be from my bank called me asking for my PIN, should I give it to them?",,"Absolutely not! Your bank will never ask for your PIN, full password, or card details over the phone. This is a clear sign of a scam. Even if the caller knows some of your personal details or claims to be calling from your bank's fraud department, legitimate banks will never request this information. Hang up immediately. If you're concerned about the call, wait at least 5 minutes (fraudsters sometimes stay on the line) and then call your bank directly using the number on the back of your card or from your bank statements.

If the person who passed the counterfeit notes is still present or nearby, call 999 immediately. If they're no longer present, report it via 101, by attending your local police station, or online depending on your force area. Keep the counterfeit notes as evidence, ideally in a plastic wallet or paper envelope to preserve potential fingerprints. If there's CCTV footage of the suspect, download and provide it to the police along with the counterfeit currency. Counterfeit currency should be reported to your local police force, not Action Fraud, as police are responsible for investigating these matters.

"I received an email claiming to be from the NCA about illegal content, is this real?",,"No, this is a scam. The National Crime Agency (NCA) will not send unsolicited emails threatening you with arrest or demanding money. These emails are designed to scare and pressure victims into responding, often leading to blackmail or fraud. The scammers may claim to have evidence of illegal activity and threaten to add you to a sex offenders register or issue arrest warrants. They may quote legislation to make the threat sound legitimate, but this is all fake. If you have doubts about any message claiming to be from the NCA, call them directly on 0370 496 7622 to verify.

"Someone claiming to be a police officer called me asking me to move money to a secure account, should I do it?",,"No, this is courier fraud - a sophisticated scam where criminals impersonate police officers or bank officials. The police will never call you to ask you to move money to a 'secure account' or verify your personal details by phone. This scam often involves the fraudster claiming to be investigating fraud on your account and asking you to withdraw money or transfer funds to 'protect' it. They may even send someone to your home to collect cash or bank cards. If you receive such a call, hang up immediately. If you need to verify the call was legitimate, wait 5 minutes (fraudsters may stay on the line) and call your bank directly using the number on your card.

"I received an email with my password in the subject line threatening to share videos of me, what should I do?",,"This is a sextortion scam - a type of phishing attack designed to scare you into paying a ransom. The scammers include your actual password (likely obtained from a data breach) to make the threat seem credible, but they don't actually have any compromising videos of you. Don't reply to the email or click any links. Don't be tempted to pay the Bitcoin ransom - this will only encourage the criminals and they may demand more money. Forward the email to report@phishing.gov.uk and then delete it. If you've already made a Bitcoin payment, report it to your local police force by calling 101. If the email includes a password you still use, change it immediately. You can check if your accounts have been compromised at haveibeenpwned.com.

How can I tell if a pension offer is a scam?,,"Pension scams can be hard to spot, but there are several warning signs. Be very wary if you're contacted out of the blue about pension opportunities - legitimate financial advisers don't cold call. Scammers often claim to be authorised by the FCA or acting on behalf of government services like Pension Wise. They may offer free pension reviews, guaranteed higher returns, or help to release cash from your pension before age 55 (which is almost always a scam). High-pressure sales tactics with 'time-limited offers' are a major red flag. Check the FCA Register to ensure anyone offering financial advice is properly authorised, and verify they're not a clone firm pretending to be legitimate. Be suspicious of unusual investments like overseas property or renewable energy bonds. If you're unsure, seek impartial guidance from the Pensions Advisory Service or Pension Wise. If you suspect a scam, report it to Action Fraud online or call 0300 123 2040, and to the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.",Action Fraud pension scam prevention guidance,https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/a-z-of-fraud/pension-scams,1,7,gemini

If you're expecting a bank statement and it doesn't arrive, tell your bank or credit card company. You should also report the fraud to Action Fraud online or call 0300 123 2040. Consider contacting CIFAS to apply for protective registration, which means extra checks will be carried out when financial services are applied for using your details.

Change all your passwords, especially for banking and email accounts, using a different device. Report the incident to Action Fraud online or call 0300 123 2040, but use a different computer to make the report. If you're unable to access your computer or files, you may need professional help.

"Someone claiming to be from a company I do business with emailed me asking to change bank account details, is this legitimate?",,"This could be mandate fraud (also known as Payment Diversion Fraud or Business Email Compromise). Criminals often create fake email addresses that look very similar to genuine business addresses and send fake invoices or requests to change bank account details. They may have spent hours researching your business to make the scam more believable. Never change payment details based on an email alone. Always verify any payment requests or account changes directly with the company using contact details you find independently (not from the email). Call the company on a known phone number or visit their office in person. If you're a business, implement the Take Five to Stop Fraud advice: STOP before making urgent payments, CHALLENGE requests by verifying them directly, and PROTECT your business by contacting your bank immediately if you think you've been scammed. Report any suspicious emails to Action Fraud online or call 0300 123 2040.

"I feel embarrassed about being scammed, is this normal?",,"Yes, feeling embarrassed about being scammed is completely normal, but you shouldn't feel ashamed. Scammers are sophisticated criminals who spend hours researching their victims and use psychological techniques to manipulate people.

How do I protect myself from identity theft?,,"To protect yourself from identity theft, never throw out anything with your name, address, or financial details without shredding it first. Be very careful about unsolicited emails or phone calls asking for personal information - legitimate organisations won't approach you this way. If you're concerned about a call, ask for a main switchboard number or hang up and call back using official contact details. Check your bank statements carefully and report anything suspicious immediately. If you move house, always get Royal Mail to redirect your post. Get regular copies of your credit report from credit reference agencies to check for any unauthorised accounts. Consider signing up for CIFAS protective registration, which adds extra checks when financial services are applied for using your details. Be careful about what you share on social media - fraudsters can use publicly available information to build profiles of potential victims.

"I received a cheque for more than the agreed amount and was asked to send back the difference, should I do it?",,"No, this is cheque overpayment fraud - a common scam. The fraudster will give you a fake cheque written for more than the agreed value and ask you to send back the difference. They'll give you an excuse for the overpayment, but the cheque will bounce and you'll lose both the money you sent back and whatever you were selling. This scam is often used for bogus job opportunities or when selling items through classified adverts. Never send money back based on a cheque that hasn't fully cleared. Cheques should clear with money in your account after the sixth working day - don't assume anything before that. If you've already fallen victim to this scam, contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud online or call 0300 123 2040.

How can I tell if an online advert is a scam?,,"Scam adverts can be hard to spot as they often look genuine. Be suspicious of adverts offering goods at unusually low prices or with false celebrity endorsements. Scammers may use fake testimonials or create professional-looking websites to appear legitimate. If an advert seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of adverts that pressure you to act quickly with 'limited time offers' or create urgency. Check if the website has secure connections (https://) and look for contact details like a physical address and phone number. Be suspicious if the seller only accepts unusual payment methods or asks for payment before you receive the goods. If you're buying from a classified advert site, meet the seller in person in a safe public place and pay only when you've seen the item. You can report suspicious adverts to the National Cyber Security Centre through Action Fraud.

"I'm worried that fraud might be funding terrorism, what should I do?",,"If you're concerned that suspected fraudulent activity may be connected to funding terrorist activity, you should report your concerns. Like other criminals, terrorists sometimes need access to funds to help them plan attacks. Some examples of suspicious activity could include carrying out unusual bank transactions or holding passports or other documents in different names for no obvious reasons. Don't worry about wasting police time - no call or click will be ignored. What you tell Action Fraud is treated in the strictest confidence and is thoroughly researched by experienced officers before any police action is taken. You can report your concerns to Action Fraud online or visit gov.uk/ACT to make an online report. If you see or hear something unusual or suspicious, trust your instincts and ACT - Action Counters Terrorism. Remember, when attacks have happened in the past, people have said they suspected something was wrong but worried about coming forward. Your information could be crucial in preventing harm.",Action Fraud terrorism funding reporting guidance,https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/faq,1,15,gemini
How do I know if my fraud report will be investigated by the police?,,"After you report fraud to Action Fraud, your report is sent to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) for assessment. Experienced reviewers assess the data to determine whether there's enough information to send to a police force for investigation. However, police forces cannot be compelled to accept crime reports sent to them by NFIB - they review each report themselves and decide on their course of action. Not all reports result in police investigation, but all reports help build intelligence about fraud patterns and help protect others. Some reports are sent to forces as intelligence to enable appropriate action, while others are sent to the Prevention and Disruption Team to block fraud enablers like telephone numbers or website addresses. All reports are analysed to provide timely information and Protect advice to the public. Even if your specific case isn't investigated, your report contributes to the overall fight against fraud and helps protect others from similar scams.",Action Fraud investigation process and NFIB procedures,https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/faq,1,15,gemini
What is the difference between Action Fraud and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau?,,"Action Fraud is the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime, taking crime and information reports on behalf of the police and providing advice and fraud prevention guidance. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) sits alongside Action Fraud within the City of London Police and is the national policing lead for economic crime. All reports made to Action Fraud are received into NFIB and assessed to determine the most appropriate action. The NFIB collates and analyses intelligence on fraud from across the UK, helping to build a clearer picture of where and how fraud is being committed. This analysis helps the public, law enforcement, and businesses better protect themselves. While Action Fraud focuses on taking reports and providing victim support, the NFIB focuses on intelligence analysis and determining which cases should be sent to police forces for investigation. Together, they work to combat fraud and cyber crime across the UK.",Action Fraud and NFIB roles and responsibilities,https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/faq,1,15,gemini
How can I make a complaint about Action Fraud?,,"If you want to make a complaint about Action Fraud, first read their Complaints Policy for guidance. Action Fraud and the NFIB are hosted by the City of London Police, and complaints can be made to the City of London Professional Standards Directorate (PSD) or to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). You can make a complaint via the City of London Police website or the IOPC website. However, it's important to note that neither Action Fraud nor the NFIB have investigative powers, and the NFIB is operationally independent. The complaints team has no authority over the NFIB to further review and forward cases to local forces for investigation. The police complaints system is not designed to consider operational decisions, so if your complaint is about a decision not to record a crime or refer a reported fraud for investigation, they won't be able to take further action. Action Fraud is aware of feedback about the term 'viable lines of enquiry' and is reviewing correspondence to provide greater clarity.",Action Fraud complaints procedure and limitations,https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/faq,1,15,gemini

Police Scotland has their own procedures for handling fraud reports and will provide appropriate guidance and support.

Be alert and if someone is crowding or watching you, cancel the transaction and go to another machine. Don't accept help from seemingly well-meaning strangers and never allow yourself to be distracted. Put your money and card away before leaving the cash machine. If an ATM eats your card, report it to your card company straight away, ideally using your mobile while still at the machine.

How can I tell if a call centre is legitimate?,,"Legitimate call centres will never pressure you to provide personal information immediately or make urgent decisions. Be suspicious if the caller asks for your PIN, full password, or card details. If you're unsure about a call, ask for a main switchboard number or hang up and call the organisation back using contact details you find independently (not from the caller). Wait at least 5 minutes before calling back as fraudsters sometimes stay on the line. Check if the organisation is legitimate by looking up their official contact details online. Be wary of callers who create urgency or threaten consequences if you don't act quickly.

Instead, type the official website address directly into your browser or search for the organisation and read the search results carefully.

Should I have given it to them?,,"No, you should never give your PIN to anyone, even if they claim to be from your bank and know some of your details. Legitimate banks will never ask for your PIN, full password, or card details over the phone. The fact that they knew some of your details doesn't make them genuine - scammers often have access to leaked data or use social engineering to gather information. You did the right thing by being cautious. Contact your bank directly using the number on the back of your card to report this incident. You should also report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. If you did share any information, contact your bank immediately to secure your account.

I'm worried about my smart home devices being hacked. How can I protect them?,,"To protect your smart home devices from being hacked, start by changing any default passwords when you first set up the device. Create a secure password by combining three random words that you'll remember. Enable 2-step verification (2SV) if the device offers it, as this provides an extra layer of protection. Keep your devices updated by switching on automatic updates if available, and install any manual updates when prompted. If you don't need remote access to your device when you're away from home, disable this feature to reduce the risk. Check your router settings and consider disabling UPnP and port forwarding, as these can be exploited by cyber criminals. Always buy devices from reputable manufacturers and avoid devices that are no longer supported, as they won't receive security updates.",Smart devices: using them safely in your home,https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/smart-devices-in-the-home,1,8,gemini
I'm selling my old phone. How do I make sure all my personal data is removed?,,"Before selling your phone, make sure you have a backup of all the personal data you want to keep. Then perform a factory reset (or 'Erase all Content and Settings' on Apple devices) to completely remove all your personal data. This will delete your messages, contacts, photographs, browsing history, Wi-Fi codes, passwords, and any apps you've installed. Make sure you don't choose the option to keep personal files if you're selling the device. If you use your phone to access online services, make sure you know which accounts you access and have the logins and passwords for each. If you use your phone to control smart devices or for 2-step verification, make sure you can manage these using a different device before erasing your data.

These stores have security measures in place to prevent malicious apps from being distributed. However, you should make sure your apps and the smartphone itself are set to update automatically. Regular updates help protect your device from security vulnerabilities. If you're downloading apps from other sources or have a device that allows installation from unknown sources, then you might want to consider antivirus software, but the best protection is to stick to official app stores and keep your device updated.",What is an antivirus product?

Create a secure password by combining three random words. Keep your camera updated by regularly installing software updates, and switch on automatic updates if available. If you don't need the feature that lets you remotely view camera footage via the internet, disable it to reduce the risk of unauthorised access. Check your router settings and consider disabling UPnP and port forwarding, as these technologies can be exploited by cyber criminals to access devices on your network. Be aware that disabling these features may prevent certain applications from working. For older cameras, you may need to access the camera's settings through your browser using its IP address. Always refer to the manufacturer's documentation for specific instructions for your model.",'Smart' security cameras: Using them safely in your home,https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/smart-security-cameras-using-them-safely-in-your-home,1,12,gemini
What is 2-step verification and why should I use it?,,"2-step verification (2SV) is a security feature that provides an extra layer of protection for your online accounts. It works by asking for additional information to prove your identity when you log in, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if a cyber criminal knows your password, they won't be able to access your account without the second step. You should use 2SV on your important accounts, especially your email (as criminals can use email access to reset passwords on other accounts), banking, social media, and cloud storage. Most major online services offer 2SV, and you can usually find the option to turn it on in your account's security settings. The NCSC recommends using 2SV wherever possible to protect your personal information and prevent unauthorised access to your accounts.",Setting up 2-Step Verification (2SV),https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-2-step-verification-2sv,1,9,gemini
I'm using video conferencing for the first time. How can I stay safe?,,"To stay safe when using video conferencing, start by downloading software only from trusted sources like official app stores or the service provider's official website. Be wary of advertised links at the top of search results, as these may lead to fake sites. When setting up your account, use a strong, unique password and enable 2-step verification if available. Test the service before your first call to ensure your microphone and camera work correctly. Learn how to mute your microphone and turn off your camera for better control. Don't make calls public - use private links and consider setting up password protection for your meetings. Always verify who is joining your call, and consider using the lobby feature to screen participants. Be mindful of your surroundings and what your camera shows. Finally, keep all your devices and applications updated to protect against security vulnerabilities.",Video conferencing services: using them securely,https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/video-conferencing-services-using-them-securely,1,6,gemini
How can I create a strong password that I can remember?,,"The best way to create a strong password is to combine three random words that mean something to you. For example, 'HippoPizzaRocket' or 'BlueCarrotMountain'. You can include numbers and symbols if needed, like 'Hippo!PizzaRocket1'. Avoid using words that can be easily guessed, such as your pet's name, birth date, or common words. Make sure your password is different for each important account, especially your email, banking, and social media accounts. If you use the same password for multiple accounts, criminals who steal it from one account can access all your others. Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords securely. Remember, your email password should be particularly strong since criminals can use access to your email to reset passwords on your other accounts.",Cyber Aware,https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberaware/home,1,13,gemini
I'm worried about my child's safety when gaming online. What should I know?,,"Online gaming can expose children to various risks including cyberbullying, excessive screen time, and unscrupulous games that encourage in-app purchases. To protect younger players, make sure their devices are secure and their accounts are protected with strong passwords. Help them understand the importance of not sharing personal information with other players. Monitor their gaming time and set appropriate limits. Be aware of the games they're playing and check if they have age-appropriate content. Look out for games that encourage children to pay for content or make purchases. You can find helpful resources from organisations like ThinkUKnow (www.thinkuknow.co.uk), Internet Matters (www.internetmatters.org), and the NSPCC (www.nspcc.org.uk) for more detailed guidance on protecting children online.

I bought something online but never received it. What can I do?,,"If you don't receive an item you've purchased online, first contact the seller to check the status of your order. If you paid by credit card, you have protection under the Consumer Credit Act. If you used a debit card, you might be able to make a claim for a refund under the voluntary 'chargeback' scheme. If you paid through services like PayPal, check their terms and conditions for buyer protection. If the seller is unresponsive or you suspect fraud, contact your bank immediately. You can also report the incident to Action Fraud (for England, Wales and Northern Ireland) or Police Scotland (for Scotland). Citizens Advice has useful information about getting your money back if you paid by credit card, debit card or PayPal.

How can I tell if a social media account is fake?,,"There are several signs that a social media account might be fake. Look for accounts with nonsensical names that appear to be random letters and numbers. Check when the account was created - very recent accounts might be suspicious. Be wary of accounts with very few followers, though note that followers can be bought. Many platforms have verification badges for real accounts of well-known people. If someone you know posts something suspicious or out of character, contact them through another method to check if their account has been hacked. You can report fake accounts directly to the platform - most social media sites have reporting functions for impersonation and fake profiles. If you suspect an account has been taken over, the owner should follow the NCSC's guidance on recovering hacked accounts. Always be cautious about accepting friend requests or following accounts that seem suspicious.",Social Media: how to use it safely,https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/social-media-how-to-use-it-safely,1,4,gemini
I'm buying a second-hand device. How can I make sure it's safe to use?,,"When buying a second-hand device, avoid devices that are no longer supported by the manufacturer, as they won't receive security updates and are easier to hack. Check online to see if the specific model can still receive updates. Once you receive the device, perform a factory reset to remove all the previous owner's personal data, including messages, contacts, photographs, browsing history, Wi-Fi codes, passwords, and apps. This ensures the device is in the best possible state before you start using it. The exact reset process varies between different models, so check the manufacturer's website for specific instructions. When setting up the device, switch on automatic updates, set up a screen lock, password, fingerprint or PIN, and consider enabling automatic backups. These steps will help keep your device and data secure.",Buying and selling second-hand devices,https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/buying-selling-second-hand-devices,1,10,gemini
Do I need antivirus software on my computer?,,"Yes, you should always use antivirus software on your computer.

Modern operating systems often include built-in antivirus software - make sure this is switched on for instant protection. New computers may come with trial versions of separate antivirus products, but be aware that when the trial expires, you'll need to pay to continue using it. Separate antivirus products might not work alongside built-in antivirus software and could even stop it from working. When you first install or switch on your antivirus, run a full scan to check for malware. Make sure it's set to automatically scan new files and receive updates automatically. Keep your antivirus software updated to protect against the latest threats.",What is an antivirus product? Do I need one?,https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/what-is-an-antivirus-product,1,11,gemini
How can I protect my privacy on social media?,,"To protect your privacy on social media, use privacy settings to control who can see your posts and personal information. Think carefully about what you're posting and who has access to it. Consider what your followers and friends need to know versus what could be useful to criminals. Be aware of your digital footprint - the information about you that's available online. Criminals can use this information to steal your identity or make phishing messages more convincing. Check what your friends, colleagues or other contacts say about you online. Use 2-step verification (2SV) on your social media accounts for extra protection. Be cautious about accepting friend requests from people you don't know, and verify that requests from people you do know are genuine.
