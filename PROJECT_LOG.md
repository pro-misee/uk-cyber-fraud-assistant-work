**Rationale**: Superior instruction-following and reduced content filtering  
**Impact**: Better suited for fraud guidance generation  

**Technical Changes**:
- Base Model: `NousResearch/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` → `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`

### 2025-08-06: Training Attempt V1 (111 Samples)
**Notebook**: `Unsloth_Fine_Tuning.ipynb`  
**Dataset**: 111 Q&A pairs (88 train, 23 validation)  
**Duration**: 181.6 seconds  

**Training Configuration**:
```
Base Model: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
LoRA Config: r=64, alpha=128, dropout=0
Learning Rate: 1e-4
Batch Size: 2 (effective 16 with grad accumulation)
Epochs: 5
Optimizer: adamw_torch
Weight Decay: 0.01
```

**Results**:
```
Epoch 1: Train Loss 2.291 → Val Loss 1.461
Epoch 2: Train Loss 1.291 → Val Loss 1.120  
Epoch 3: Train Loss 0.846 → Val Loss 1.058 ✅ (Best)
Epoch 4: Train Loss 0.509 → Val Loss 1.208 ❌ (Overfitting)
Epoch 5: Train Loss 0.187 → Val Loss 1.211 ❌ (Continued overfitting)
Final Training Loss: 0.9055
```

**Issues Identified**:
- Overfitting after epoch 3 due to small dataset (88 samples)
- Validation loss increased from 1.058 → 1.211
- Model memorizing rather than generalizing

**Lessons Learned**:
- Need larger dataset for 7B parameter model
- Early stopping required to prevent overfitting
- 111 samples insufficient for stable training

---

### 2025-08-07: Dataset Expansion
**Event**: Dataset scaled from 111 → 278 Q&A pairs  
**Method**: Enhanced Q&A generation using improved prompts  
**File**: `model_training/master_fraud_qa_dataset.json`  

**Data Sources Expanded**:
- Enhanced existing sources with more comprehensive extraction
- Added additional UK fraud guidance sources
- Improved prompt engineering for better Q&A quality

**Quality Improvements**:

### 2025-08-07: Training Attempt V2 (278 Samples - First Try)
**Notebook**: `Unsloth_Fine_Tuning_v2.ipynb`  
**Dataset**: 278 Q&A pairs (222 train, 56 validation)  
**Early Stopping**: Added with patience=2

**Training Configuration**:
```
Learning Rate: 1e-4 (kept same as V1)
Epochs: 5
Early Stopping: patience=2
Other params: Same as V1
```

**Results**:
```
Epoch 1: Train Loss 1.234 → Val Loss 1.133
Epoch 2: Train Loss 0.632 → Val Loss 1.057 ✅ (Best)
Epoch 3: Train Loss 0.299 → Val Loss 1.127 ❌ (Started overfitting)
Epoch 4: Train Loss 0.169 → Val Loss 1.337 ❌ (Early stopping triggered)
Training Time: 327.9 seconds
Final Training Loss: 0.6623
```

**Issues Identified**:
- Still overfitting despite larger dataset
- Training loss dropped too aggressively (1.234 → 0.169)
- Early stopping triggered correctly but problem persists

**Analysis**:
- Learning rate too high for dataset size
- Need more conservative training approach
- Model still learning too fast despite early stopping

---

### 2025-08-07: Parameter Optimization Analysis
**Event**: Analysis of V2 overfitting issues  
**Findings**:
- Training loss dropped 91% in single epoch (too aggressive)
- Validation loss exploded from 1.133 → 1.337
- Need significant parameter adjustments

**Proposed Changes**:
- Reduce learning rate: 1e-4 → 5e-5
- Reduce LoRA rank: 64 → 32
- Increase warmup: 10 → 20 steps
- Increase weight decay: 0.01 → 0.05
- Increase early stopping patience: 2 → 3

---

### 2025-08-07: Training Attempt V2.1 (Parameter Adjustment Test)
**Event**: Test run with reduced LoRA rank  
**Configuration Change**: r=64 → r=32, alpha=128 → alpha=64  

**Results**: 
```
Epoch 1: Train Loss 0.780 → Val Loss 2.393 ❌ (Severe overfitting)
Epoch 2: Train Loss 0.071 → Val Loss 5.091 ❌ (Validation loss exploded)
Training stopped due to severe overfitting
```

**Critical Error Analysis**:
- LoRA rank too low (32) created information bottleneck
- Model forced to overfit aggressively to compensate
- Validation loss doubled then exploded
- r=32 insufficient for 7B model with 278 samples

**Immediate Decision**: Revert LoRA rank and try different approach

---

### 2025-08-07: Training Attempt V3 (Optimized Parameters) ✅
**Event**: Successful training with optimized configuration

Learning Rate: 2e-5 (reduced from 1e-4)
Warmup Steps: 20 (increased from 10)
Weight Decay: 0.05 (increased from 0.01)
Early Stopping: patience=3
Epochs: 5
```

**Results** ✅:
```
Epoch 1: Train Loss 2.187 → Val Loss 1.509 (Stable start)
Epoch 2: Train Loss 1.153 → Val Loss 1.213 (Consistent improvement)
Epoch 3: Train Loss 0.881 → Val Loss 1.154 (Continued learning)

## Key Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **LoRA Rank Critical**: Too low (32) caused severe overfitting, optimal appears to be 48-64 for 7B models
2. **Learning Rate Sensitivity**: 2e-5 optimal for this dataset size vs 1e-4 too aggressive  
3. **Dataset Size Impact**: 278 samples minimum viable, 1000+ needed for production
4. **Early Stopping Effectiveness**: Prevents overfitting but root cause must be addressed
5. **Mistral-7B Superior**: Better instruction following than LLaMA alternatives

### Project Management
1. **Iterative Approach**: V1 → V2 → V3 progression essential for optimization
2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Critical for understanding parameter impact
3. **Deployment Testing**: Early validation prevents late-stage issues
4. **Documentation Currency**: Must reflect actual current state, not plans
