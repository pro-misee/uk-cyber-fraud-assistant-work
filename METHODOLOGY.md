# Methodology

## 3.1 Research Design and Methodology Overview

This chapter presents a systematic approach for developing a conversational AI system to support UK cyber fraud victims through domain-specific fine-tuning of Large Language Models. The methodology employs a pragmatic research paradigm that focuses on technical implementation and performance evaluation, acknowledging that AI systems for vulnerable populations require both technical rigour and practical effectiveness.

The research follows a design science approach, combining experimental development with empirical evaluation to create and validate a novel artefact—a fine-tuned Mistral-7B chatbot designed to address the current inadequacy of support mechanisms for UK cyber fraud victims. This approach responds directly to gaps identified in the literature regarding the adaptation of general-purpose language models for specialised applications requiring both factual precision and emotional sensitivity.

The methodology is structured around seven core phases:
1. **Multi-source data collection framework** using automated web scraping
2. **Enhanced AI-powered Q&A generation** using Gemini AI with optimised prompt engineering
3. **Advanced model selection and configuration** with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
4. **Unsloth-optimised fine-tuning implementation** using full precision LoRA methodology
5. **GGUF quantisation and deployment** for local inference systems
6. **Multi-platform deployment framework** supporting LM Studio
7. **Comprehensive evaluation framework** for UK-specific fraud support effectiveness

This systematic approach ensures reproducibility whilst addressing the specific requirements of creating empathetic, contextually-aware conversational AI for crisis support scenarios, demonstrated through a complete pipeline from data collection to production-ready local deployment.
