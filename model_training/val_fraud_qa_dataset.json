Real police officers and bank officials will never ask for your PIN, personal details, or passwords over the phone to verify your identity. This is a major red flag. If someone claiming to be from your bank or police calls about suspicious activity but asks for personal information, hang up immediately. If they offer to call you back to prove they're genuine, be aware that fraudsters can stay on the line even after you hang up, so there may be no dial tone when you try to make another call. Wait at least five minutes, or use a different phone entirely, before calling your bank back using the number on your card or statement. Report this suspicious call to your bank and to Action Fraud. Trust your instincts - legitimate organisations don't operate this way, and you're absolutely right to question this call.",

They will pressure you to pay this fee quickly, often through a bank transfer or by purchasing vouchers. Once you have paid the fee, you will never receive the loan, and you will not get your money back. You should never pay an upfront fee for a loan.

    "input": "",
    "output": "It's important to be cautious when dating online to protect yourself from romance fraud. One way to do this is to use secure messaging apps that can help to verify the identity of the person you're talking to. Be wary of anyone who asks for money, regardless of the reason they give. You should also be cautious about sharing personal information, such as your address or financial details. If you're unsure about someone, you can do a reverse image search to see if their photos have been used elsewhere. Trust your instincts, and if something feels wrong, it probably is. Remember that genuine relationships are built on trust and mutual respect, not on financial transactions.",

    "instruction": "What is a 419 scam?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A 419 scam is a type of advance fee fraud. The name comes from the section of the Nigerian legal code that deals with this type of crime. In a 419 scam, you are typically contacted by someone who claims to need your help to transfer a large sum of money out of their country. They will promise you a share of the money in return for your help, but they will first ask you to pay a fee to cover the costs of the transfer. If you pay the fee, you will never see the money you were promised, and you will lose the money you paid. If you are contacted by someone who is asking for your help to transfer money, you should be very suspicious. You should never send money to someone you don't know, and you should never give out your personal or financial information.",
