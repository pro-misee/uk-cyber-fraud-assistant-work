Scammers create false urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly and doing proper checks. Your bank, the police, government departments, or legitimate companies will never demand immediate payment or threaten you with arrest or legal action if you don't pay straight away. If someone is pressuring you to act quickly, this is almost certainly a scam. Hang up the phone, delete suspicious emails, and don't respond to threatening messages. If you're unsure, contact the organization directly using contact details from their official website (never from the suspicious communication).

Check if the firm is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) by searching the FCA Register. Be suspicious of promises of high returns with low risk - if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Legitimate investment firms won't pressure you to act quickly or make you feel like you're missing out on a limited-time opportunity. Be wary of investments in unusual assets like overseas property, renewable energy bonds, or storage units, especially if they're unregulated. Check the FCA Warning List to see if the firm is known to be operating without authorization. Be cautious of complex investment structures where it's unclear where your money will end up. If you're unsure, seek independent financial advice from an FCA-authorized adviser. Remember, if you invest with an unauthorized firm, you won't have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme if things go wrong. If you suspect an investment scam, report it to Action Fraud and the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.",

    "instruction": "What should I do if I receive counterfeit currency?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "If you receive counterfeit currency, don't try to pass it on to someone else - this is illegal. If the person who gave you the counterfeit notes is still present or nearby, consider calling the police on 999. If they're not present, report it to your local police by calling 101, attending your local police station, or reporting online depending on your force area. Keep the counterfeit notes as evidence, ideally in a plastic wallet or paper envelope to preserve any fingerprints. If you have CCTV footage of the person who gave you the counterfeit currency, download it and provide it to the police along with the notes. Don't handle the notes more than necessary to preserve evidence. You can check if notes are genuine by looking for security features - the Bank of England website has detailed guidance on how to check banknotes. Remember, Action Fraud doesn't deal with counterfeit currency - this should be reported directly to the police. If you have information about people making, supplying, or passing counterfeit currency, you can report it anonymously to CrimeStoppers on 0800 555 111.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "To protect yourself from ATM fraud, always cover your PIN when entering it using your free hand and body to shield the keypad. Be alert to your surroundings and if someone is crowding or watching you, cancel the transaction and use a different machine. Don't accept help from strangers at ATMs, even if they seem well-meaning. Check the ATM for any signs of tampering or unusual devices before using it. If the machine looks suspicious or has been tampered with, don't use it and report it to the bank immediately. Put your personal safety first - if someone makes you feel uncomfortable, cancel the transaction and leave. Once you've completed a transaction, put your money and card away before leaving the ATM. Destroy or shred your ATM receipts when you're done with them. If the ATM doesn't return your card, report it immediately to your card company, ideally using your mobile while still at the machine. Keep your card company's 24-hour contact number stored in your phone. Be extra careful when using ATMs abroad and consider using ATMs inside banks when possible.",

    "output": "If you receive an email claiming to be from the National Crime Agency (NCA) or police, be very suspicious.

The NCA will not send unsolicited correspondence requesting money or bank details. If you have doubts about an email claiming to be from the NCA, you can call them on 0370 496 7622 to verify. Don't reply to the email or click on any links. Instead, forward suspicious emails to report@phishing.gov.uk and then delete them. If you've lost money or been hacked as a result of responding to such an email, report it to Action Fraud online or by calling 0300 123 2040.

    "instruction": "How can I protect myself from mandate fraud?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Mandate fraud, also known as Payment Diversion Fraud, involves criminals impersonating legitimate businesses to redirect payments. To protect yourself, be extremely cautious of emails requesting changes to payment details or bank account information. Always verify payment requests directly with the company using known contact details - never use contact details provided in the suspicious email. Be suspicious of urgent payment requests or pressure to act quickly. Check email addresses carefully - scammers often use addresses that look similar to genuine ones but have slight differences. If you're a business, implement procedures requiring verbal confirmation of payment changes. Be wary of emails claiming to be from suppliers with new bank account details. If you receive such a request, contact the supplier directly using their known phone number to verify the change. Never make payments based solely on email requests without verification. If you suspect mandate fraud, contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud. Remember the Take Five to Stop Fraud advice: STOP, CHALLENGE, PROTECT. Take a moment to stop and think before making any payments.",

    "output": "If you receive a suspicious cheque, be very careful. Common red flags include: cheques for more than the agreed amount with requests to send back the difference, cheques from unknown sources, and pressure to cash the cheque quickly. Be suspicious if someone asks you to cash a cheque and send them money back - this is a common scam. Cheques should clear with money in your account after the sixth working day, but nothing is guaranteed before that. If you're unsure about a cheque, don't cash it until you're certain it's legitimate. Be wary of cheques that look unusual, have poor quality printing, or contain spelling mistakes. If you receive a cheque that seems suspicious, contact your bank for advice. Never send goods or money based on a cheque that hasn't fully cleared. If you've been given a counterfeit or fraudulent cheque, report it to Action Fraud online or by calling 0300 123 2040. Remember, legitimate businesses and individuals won't pressure you to act quickly or ask you to send money back after overpaying by cheque.",

    "output": "To protect yourself from online shopping fraud, only shop on secure websites - look for the padlock symbol and 'https' in the address bar. Be suspicious of websites offering products at prices that seem too good to be true. Check for contact information and physical addresses on the website. Read online reviews and search for complaints about the seller. Use secure payment methods like credit cards when possible, as they offer better protection than debit cards. Sign up for Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode when given the option. Never send your PIN over the internet. Print out your order and keep copies of the retailer's terms and conditions, returns policy, and contact details. Be wary of sellers who only accept bank transfers or cryptocurrency payments. If you're buying from classified ads or auction sites, be especially cautious of overseas buyers who agree to prices without seeing items. Use secure payment platforms like PayPal when possible. If you suspect you've been scammed, contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud. Remember, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
