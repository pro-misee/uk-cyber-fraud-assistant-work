    "output": "Different banks have different policies, but all have a responsibility to protect your money. Banks should investigate fraud reports quickly and make all reasonable efforts to recover money where possible. They should keep you informed about the progress of your case and explain their decisions clearly. If you think your bank hasn't handled your case properly, you have the right to challenge their decision. You can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service if you're not satisfied with your bank's response. Keep all correspondence and evidence including statements, emails, and phone call records. Banks should follow the Payment Services Regulations and Banking Conduct of Business rules. For APP fraud, the new reimbursement requirement came into force on 7 October 2024. If you're unhappy with how your case has been handled, don't give up - escalate your complaint and seek independent advice if necessary.",
