Remember that Action Fraud takes the initial report and passes it to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) for assessment. The NFIB then decides whether to send the case to a police force for investigation.

You can do this by logging into your account if you registered, or by calling 0300 123 2040.

The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) sits alongside Action Fraud within the City of London Police and is the national policing lead for economic crime. All reports made to Action Fraud are received into NFIB and assessed to determine the most appropriate action. The NFIB collates and analyses intelligence on fraud from across the UK, helping to build a clearer picture of where and how fraud is being committed. This analysis helps the public, law enforcement, and businesses better protect themselves. While Action Fraud focuses on taking reports and providing victim support, the NFIB focuses on intelligence analysis and determining which cases should be sent to police forces for investigation.

However, it's important to note that neither Action Fraud nor the NFIB have investigative powers, and the NFIB is operationally independent. The complaints team has no authority over the NFIB to further review and forward cases to local forces for investigation. The police complaints system is not designed to consider operational decisions, so if your complaint is about a decision not to record a crime or refer a reported fraud for investigation, they won't be able to take further action.
