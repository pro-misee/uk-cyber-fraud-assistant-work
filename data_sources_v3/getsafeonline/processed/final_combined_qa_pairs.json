    "input": "",
    "output": "Be suspicious of job offers that require you to pay money upfront for training, equipment, or background checks. Legitimate employers don't ask for payment to hire you. Research the company online and check if they're registered with Companies House. Be wary of job offers that come via unsolicited emails or social media messages. Check the company's website and contact details. Be suspicious if the interview is only conducted online or if you're asked to provide personal information before meeting anyone. Legitimate employers will want to meet you in person and won't pressure you to accept the job immediately. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Report suspicious job offers to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.",
