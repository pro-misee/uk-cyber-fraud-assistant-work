Even if the offer isn't a scam, investing in unregulated products means you won't be protected if something goes wrong and you could lose all your money. The fact that something is environmentally friendly doesn't make it a safe investment. If you're contacted unexpectedly about this type of investment, use the FCA's Investment Checker to avoid scams. Always verify the firm using the FCA Firm Checker before investing. Be suspicious of guaranteed returns - legitimate investments don't offer guarantees.

Legitimate banks will never ask for your PIN, full password, or card details over the phone. If you're unsure about any call claiming to be from your bank, hang up and call back using the number on the back of your card or your bank statements. Never use a number provided by the caller. Check your bank account and credit card statements regularly for any suspicious transactions. If you did share any information, contact your bank immediately to secure your account. Report suspicious calls to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. Remember, it's always better to be cautious and call back on a verified number than to risk falling for a scam.",
