PROTECT means contacting your bank immediately if you think you've fallen for a scam and reporting it to Action Fraud.

In the UK, fraud is now the most prevalent crime, and scams are a major component of this. Both fraud and scams can be reported to Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre.

If you're unsure about the call, hang up and contact your bank directly using the number on the back of your card or from their official website. Don't use any phone numbers provided by the caller. Ask the caller for their name and department, then verify this information with your bank. Be suspicious of calls that create urgency or ask you to keep the call secret. Remember that scammers can spoof phone numbers to make it appear they're calling from your bank. If you've shared any information during the call, contact your bank immediately to secure your account. It's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to protecting your financial information.",
