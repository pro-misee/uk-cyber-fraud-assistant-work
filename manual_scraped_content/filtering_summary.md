## Filtered Content Examples

### **Kept - High Consumer Relevance**:
- "I saw a cryptocurrency investment on social media promising very high returns. Could this be a scam?"
- "My ex-partner keeps creating fake profiles to contact me online. Is this cyberstalking?"
- "I got a phone call from someone claiming to be my bank asking for my one-time passcode. Should I give it to them?"

### **Filtered Out - Low Consumer Relevance**:
- "What is the purpose of the malware called AUTHENTIC ANTICS?" (State-sponsored enterprise threat)
- "What advice has the NCSC given to UK organisations about the cyber threat posed by Russian groups?" (Enterprise security)
- "How much does cybercrime cost the UK each year?" (Statistical background)

## Recommendation
**Proceed with the 811-pair filtered dataset** - this represents the highest quality UK cyber fraud training data achievable, maintaining exceptional standards for individual scenarios while providing comprehensive coverage of consumer fraud categories.

The 19% reduction from 1,002 to 811 pairs significantly improves average quality by removing enterprise-focused and low-relevance content while retaining all premium consumer fraud guidance.
