Once clicked, you may be sent to a dodgy website which could download viruses onto your computer, or steal your passwords.\n\nIf you think you may have been the victim of fraud or cybercrime and incurred a financial loss or have been hacked as a result of responding to a phishing message, you should report this to Action Fraud (https://reporting.actionfraud.police.uk/login) \n\n## Have you spotted a suspicious email?\n\nIf you have received an email which you\u2019re not quite sure about, forward it to the Suspicious Email Reporting Service (SERS): report@phishing.gov.uk\n\nThe message might be from a company you don\u2019t normally receive communications from, or someone you do not know.

If the suspect is present at the location or still nearby, consideration should be given to contacting the police on 999. Counterfeit notes should be retained and provided to the police as evidence, ideally inside a plastic wallet or paper envelope to preserve potential fingerprints. If there is CCTV footage of the suspect available, this should be downloaded and provided to the police together with the counterfeit notes or coins.\n\nPlease see the links below to websites that contain further information about security features present in bank notes and coins to assist you in determining if the item is counterfeit or genuine: \n\n How to check your bank notes (https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/counterfeit-banknotes/how-to-check-your-banknotes) (Bank of England), Banknote issuers (https://www.acbi.org.uk/banknotes.html) (Scotland and Northern Ireland \u2013 how to check your bank notes) Coin designs and specifications (https://www.royalmint.com/discover/uk-coins/coin-design-and-specifications/one-pound-coin/), Euros (https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/banknotes/html/index.en.html) and dollars (https://www.uscurrency.gov/denominations). \n\nIf you have information about persons; making, supplying, passing or possessing counterfeit currency (banknotes and / or coins) please contact your local Police or report the matter anonymously to CrimeStoppers on 0800 555111 or online (https://crimestoppers-uk.org/)",

      "content": "# Fraudsters impersonate NCA officers in 'child pornography' scam emails\n\nWe have received 180 reports regarding fake emails claiming to be from the NCA.\n\nSince the beginning of December 2023, Action Fraud and the Suspicious Email Reporting System (SERS) have received over 180 reports concerning the impersonation of National Crime Agency (NCA) agents.\n\nThe victims describe receiving an email purporting to be from the NCA. The email states that the NCA has evidence that the recipient has accessed and viewed \u201cchild pornography\u201d or other \u201cillegal pornographic content\u201d.\n\nThe emails demand that the recipient make contact within a specified deadline. If they do not, the email claims that a warrant will be issued for their arrest and that the recipient\u2019s details will be added to the sex offenders register, quoting legislation in an effort to make the threat sound legitimate.\n\nIt is assessed that the intention of the email is to prompt the victim into initiating communication with the suspects so that personal information can be disclosed to be used for blackmail or to commit fraud. Unlike other emails which impersonate law enforcement, there is no up-front demand for money however, where victims have engaged with the suspects, they have demanded money at a later stage.\n\nThe use of such threatening language creates a significant and emotional impact upon the recipient. The time pressure that is applied encourages victims to panic and act without thinking, unknowingly exposing themselves to compromise and blackmail.\n\n## What you need to do\n\n- The NCA will not send unsolicited correspondence requesting money or bank details. If you have doubts about the authenticity of a message received from the NCA, please call 0370 496 7622.\n- Remember, your bank (or any other official source) will not ask you to supply personal information over email.\n- If you think an email is suspicious, you can report it by forwarding the email to: report@phishing.gov.uk.\n\n## Every report counts\n\n- If you have been a victim of fraud or cyber crime, report it to us at online or by calling 0300 123 2040.",

      "content": "# Action Fraud warns of new courier fraud tactic after receiving 120 reports in 24 hours\n\nNew alert from Action Fraud and the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) about courier fraud.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Action Fraud has received 120 reports of courier fraud. Victims have reported a particular tactic of being called by someone impersonating a police officer. The suspect uses the name Eric Shaw and gives over his badge number, in order to appear trustworthy to victims.\n\nThe suspect asks victims to move money to a \u201csecure bank account\u201d until the victims are sent a new national insurance number. In reality, their money is being transferred into an account under the criminal\u2019s control.\n\n## What is courier fraud?\n\nCourier fraud is when victims receive a phone call from a criminal, pretending to be a police officer or bank official. Typically, victims are told to withdraw a sum of money and someone is sent to their home address to collect it. Criminals may also convince the victim to transfer money to a \u2018secure\u2019 bank account, hand over their bank cards, or high value items, such as jewellery, watches and gold (coins or bullion).\n\n## How to protect yourself and your loved ones:\n\n- Your bank or the police will never call you to ask you to verify your personal details or PIN by phone, or offer to pick up your bank card by courier. Hang up immediately if you receive a call like this.\n- If you need to contact your bank back to check the call was legitimate, wait five minutes; fraudsters may stay on the line after you hang up. Alternatively, use a different line altogether to contact your bank.\n- Your debit or credit card is yours: don\u2019t let a stranger take it from you. You should only ever have to hand it over at your bank. If it\u2019s cancelled or expired, you should destroy it yourself.\n\n## Spot the tell-tale signs:\n\n- Someone claiming to be from your bank or local police force calls you to tell you about fraudulent activity, but is asking you for personal information, or even your PIN, to verify who you are.\n- They\u2019re offering to call you back so you can be sure they\u2019re genuine, but when you try to return the call, there\u2019s no dial tone.\n- They say they\u2019re trying to offer you peace of mind by having somebody pick up the card for you, to save you the trouble of having to go to your bank or local police station.\n\nIf you think you\u2019ve been a victim of fraud, contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud online at actionfraud.police.uk or by calling 0300 123 2040.",

This means extra checks will be carried out when a financial service, such as a loan, is applied for using your address and personal details, to verify its you and not a fraudster.\n\nUPDATE (22/03/2021): Action Fraud continues to warn the public about a National Insurance scam, after it received over 34,000 more calls last month when compared to February 2020. Victims have reported receiving an automated telephone call telling them their \u201cNational Insurance number has been compromised\u201d and in order to fix this and get a new number, the victim needs to \u201cpress 1 on their handset to be connected to the caller\u201d. Once connected to the \u201ccaller\u201d, victims are pressured into giving over their personal details in order to receive a new National Insurance number. In reality, they\u2019ve been connected to a criminal who can now use their personal details to commit fraud.\n\n\u201cWe are asking the public to remain vigilant and be cautious of any automated calls they receive mentioning their National Insurance number becoming compromised.",

      "content": "More than \u00a31 million worth of assets have been recovered by the National Crime Agency (NCA) following a civil recovery investigation into a Nigerian fraudster and his long term British partner, who both led a extravagant lifestyles despite their combined declared annual income never exceeding \u00a348,000.\n\nAyodele Odewole (also known as Ayodele Balogun, 42), and his partner of 21 years Sara Bharat Yadav, 40, of Cranbrook Road, Chiswick, London were ordered to hand \u00a31,011,431 to the NCA at the High Court today under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\n\nThe NCA recovered \u00a3797,431 from their bank accounts; three Patek Philippe watches valued at \u00a31,094,000; and a private car registration plate worth \u00a315,000.\n\nOdewole is a convicted fraudster with numerous dishonesty offences between 1998 and 2016. Odewole made millions from his scams.\n\nHe typically targeted people living in wealthy areas, researching their details through public records and fraudulently applying for credit cards in their names, which he used to withdraw cash.\n\nOdewole was also believed to have impersonated some of his victims in phone calls to their banks, ordered and intercepted replacement debit cards, which he then used to purchase high value items such as watches. These watches were then traded and sold with the proceeds being laundered through bank accounts belonging to Odewole and Yadav.\n\nNCA investigators found that the couple had hundreds of thousands of pounds passing through their bank accounts annually, despite Odewole not having had any legitimate employment earnings since he released from prison in 2005, and far in excess of Yadav\u2019s salary as an operations manager for Imperial College.\n\nYadav and Odewole also bought properties in Westbourne Terrace, London and Conway Drive, Liverpool respectively, with significant deposits involved on each. These properties were subsequently sold whilst the NCA believed was an attempt to launder the proceeds of Odewole\u2019s criminal activities.\n\nEven when Odewale fled the UK in 2016, the couple continued to enjoy an extravagant lifestyle. The rent on Yadav\u2019s Chiswick home alone is nearly \u00a342,000 per year \u2013 more than her annual income. In the last three years they have owned expensive cars including a Porsche Carrera, two Mercedes, and Yadav currently drives a Audi RS4 which when new is worth around \u00a360,000.The couple also sent their three children to a private school which costs \u00a337,000 per year. They also enjoyed frequent  luxury holidays in India, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa, Cape Verde and Turkey.NCA investigators described one of Odewale\u2019s explanations that he made \u201chundreds of thousands of pounds\u201d to fund his lifestyle at betting shop fixed odd terminals as \u201cinherently unlikely\u201d. Odewale gave evidence to the High Court via video from Nigeria, as he is subject to a deportation order and cannot return to the UK. The High Court Judge who heard the case found he showed \u201clittle concern for the victims of the fraud\u201d and offered \u201cbare (often angry) denials\u201d to questions put to him by the NCA\u2019s barrister.Yadav, who  remained in the UK when Odewale left for Nigeria, was also found by the High Court judge Mrs Justice McGowan to have knowingly benefited from assets gained through unlawful conduct.  The judge stated that  Yadav \u201cdishonestly chose to turn a blind eye to the illegitimacy of those funds\u201d and enjoyed the luxuries it provided noting, for example, the gold Rolex she wore to the hearing.The NCA\u2019s civil recovery investigators started the investigation in December 2016, and analysed 12,000 financial transactions between 2010 and 2016.In her judgment, Mrs Justice McGowan found the NCA\u2019s evidence to be \u201cdetailed, cogent, and helpful.\u201dAndy Lewis, head of Asset Denial at the NCA, said: \u201cOdewale and Yadav had extravagant lifestyles funded from stealing the identities of honest, law abiding citizens. We have recovered their assets so they see no benefit from their unlawful activity. \u201cWe are pleased our commitment to this investigation has paid off, having worked closely with partners including the Metropolitan Police and the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit. \u201cWe will continue our work to identify those linked to economic crime, and take away their illicit assets.\u201d  Ben Russell, Deputy Director of the National Economic Crime Centre, said: \u201cFraud causes real harm to people across the UK and we are determined to use all our powers, including civil recovery, to disrupt criminals and take money and assets out of their hands. \u201cThe National Economic Crime Centre has a unique role coordinating the response to economic crime, bringing together the full force of our partners from across the public and private sector. \u201cFraud is an absolute priority for us and today\u2019s fantastic result shows what can be achieved when we use all our tools and powers to safeguard the people and prosperity of the UK.\u201d The High Court ordered that one of the watches and \u00a3140,759, which could be traced back to two specific frauds, be handed to NatWest Bank to replace money used to compensate two of their customers.",

Not all crime reports received by NFIB are sent to forces; for instance, some will be sent to forces as intelligence to enable them to take appropriate action while others will be sent to the Prevention and Disruption Team to allow for the fraud enabler (such as telephone number, website address) to be blocked to prevent others from becoming victims. All reports, whether they are a crime report or information report, will be analysed enabling us to provide timely information and Protect advice to the public.\n\n### What crimes can't I report to Action Fraud\nAction Fraud takes reports of fraud and cybercrime as set out in the Home Office Counting Rules for Fraud.\n\nWe are unable to take reports of:\n- Theft of a vehicle\n- Suspicious online behaviour with or towards a child\n- Online hate or bullying crime, material or messages\n- Counterfeit medicine or medical devices available to purchase online\n- Business or personal tax fraud\n- Benefit related\n- Immigration related\n- Counterfeit Currency\n\nIf your reports relates to any of the above, please follow the links to report it to the correct organisation.\n\n### I have concerns that fraudulent activity may be funding terrorism. What should I do?\nYou may be concerned that suspected fraudulent activity may be connected to funding terrorist activity.\n\nLike other criminals, terrorists need to plan. They sometimes need access to funds to help them.\n\nSome examples of suspicious activity could include:\n- Carrying out suspicious or unusual bank transactions\n- Holding passports or other documents in different names, for no obvious reasons\n\nWhen attacks have happened in the past, people have said that they suspected something was wrong, but worried they may waste police time by coming forward. Or that they might get someone into trouble.\n\nYou are not wasting our time, and no call or click will be ignored. What you tell us is treated in the strictest confidence and is thoroughly researched by experienced officers before, and if, any police action is taken.\n\nIf you see or hear something unusual or suspicious trust your instincts and ACT \u2013 Action Counters Terrorism.\n\nReport your concerns to Action Fraud, or visit gov.uk/ACT to make an online report.\n\n### What happens to my report once has it been made to Action Fraud?\nAfter a report has been made to Action Fraud, it will be sent for assessment by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB). This assessment of fraud and cyber crime reports from across the UK, helps to build a clear picture of where and how fraud and cyber crime is being committed. Experienced Reviewers will assess the data contained in the crime reports to determine whether there is enough information to send to a police force. It is important to be aware that police forces cannot be compelled to accept crime report sent to them by NFIB for investigation, they will review the report themselves and decide on their course of action.\n\n### I would like an update on my report?\nIf you have registered on our website, you can track the progress of your report by logging into your account.

Where Action Fraud is able to confirm that the circumstances are different to what was originally reported we are usually able to withdraw the matter as a recorded crime.\n\nA typical example of this is a report of internet shopping fraud where goods have not been delivered. Often we receive information from the person making the report that goods were either simply delivered later than expected or that goods could not be supplied through no fault of the seller and a full refund was provided.
