Forward the suspicious email to the Suspicious Email Reporting Service (SERS) at report@phishing.gov.uk. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) will analyse the email and any websites it links to. If they find it's malicious, they can block the sender's address, work with hosting companies to remove dangerous websites, and warn others about similar scams. Your quick thinking and willingness to report this could prevent many others from becoming victims. Every report counts in the fight against fraud.",

    "output": "Your instincts are right to be concerned, and I'm glad you're taking action. Phone scammers often impersonate banks and other trusted organisations. Contact your bank immediately using the number on your bank card or statement - not any number the caller gave you. Tell them what happened so they can secure your account and check for any unauthorised transactions. If you've lost money or been hacked as a result, report it to Action Fraud online or call 0300 123 2040 (in England, Wales, Northern Ireland) or Police Scotland on 101 (in Scotland). For future reference, remember that your bank will never call asking for personal details, PINs, or passwords. You're not to blame for this - these scammers are very convincing, but you're taking the right steps now.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "I understand this is concerning, especially if you're worried about the money you've lost. Here's what you need to do: Keep the counterfeit notes safe - ideally in a plastic wallet or paper envelope to preserve any potential fingerprints. Don't try to spend them as this would be illegal. If the suspect who gave you the notes is still at the location or nearby, consider calling 999. Otherwise, report it to your local police force by calling 101, visiting your local police station, or reporting online depending on your area. Provide the counterfeit notes to police as evidence. If there's CCTV footage available, ask for a copy to give to police. Remember, Action Fraud doesn't handle counterfeit currency cases - this goes directly to your local police who will work with the National Crime Agency. This isn't your fault, and reporting helps prevent others from receiving fake money.",

For Scottish and Northern Ireland notes, check acbi.org.uk/banknotes.html. If you have coins, the Royal Mint website (royalmint.com) has information on genuine coin specifications. For foreign currency, the European Central Bank covers Euros (ecb.europa.eu) and the US Treasury covers dollars (uscurrency.gov). If after checking these resources you're still unsure about notes or coins you have, contact your local police for advice.
