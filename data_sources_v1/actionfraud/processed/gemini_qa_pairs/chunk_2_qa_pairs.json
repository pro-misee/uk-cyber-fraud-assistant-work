    "output": "This is absolutely a scam, and I want you to know that you're not in any legal trouble. What you've received is a fake email designed to frighten and manipulate you. The National Crime Agency (NCA) will never send unsolicited emails demanding money or threatening arrest. These scammers use threatening language about illegal content to create panic and pressure you into responding without thinking clearly. Do not reply to the email, do not click any links, and do not provide any personal information. Instead, report it by forwarding the email to report@phishing.gov.uk and then delete it. If you have any doubts about the authenticity of any message claiming to be from the NCA, you can call them directly on 0370 496 7622. Remember, this is a cruel tactic designed to exploit your emotions - you've done nothing wrong.",

    "output": "Please take a deep breath - you are not going to be arrested. This is exactly the emotional reaction the scammers want to create. The time pressure and threatening language are classic manipulation tactics designed to make you panic and act without thinking. No legitimate law enforcement agency operates this way. Real police investigations don't happen through threatening emails with countdown timers. You are completely safe from any legal consequences because this is entirely fake. Do not respond to the email at all. Instead, forward it to report@phishing.gov.uk to help protect others, then delete it. If you're still feeling anxious, you can call the real NCA on 0370 496 7622 to confirm this is a scam. You've done the right thing by questioning this email rather than responding to it. Trust your instincts - they're protecting you.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "This is definitely a scam - do not move any money! What you're describing is courier fraud, and 'Eric Shaw' is a fake name being used by criminals across the country. Real police officers and banks will never call asking you to move money, verify personal details, or give out your PIN. They will never arrange for someone to collect your bank cards from your home. Hang up immediately if you haven't already. If you need to verify the call was fake, wait five minutes before calling your bank back (fraudsters can stay on the line), or use a different phone entirely. Contact your bank using the number on your bank card or statement to report this suspicious call. If you've already moved money or given out personal details, contact your bank immediately and report it to Action Fraud online or on 0300 123 2040. Remember: your bank card belongs to you - never let a stranger take it.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Yes, you should be very suspicious - this is a classic sign of courier fraud. Real police officers and bank officials will never ask for your PIN, personal details, or passwords over the phone to verify your identity. This is a major red flag. If someone claiming to be from your bank or police calls about suspicious activity but asks for personal information, hang up immediately. If they offer to call you back to prove they're genuine, be aware that fraudsters can stay on the line even after you hang up, so there may be no dial tone when you try to make another call. Wait at least five minutes, or use a different phone entirely, before calling your bank back using the number on your card or statement. Report this suspicious call to your bank and to Action Fraud. Trust your instincts - legitimate organisations don't operate this way, and you're absolutely right to question this call.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "No, absolutely do not press 1! This is a well-known National Insurance scam that has been reported over 34,000 times. Your National Insurance number cannot be 'compromised' or suspended in the way these calls claim. The automated message is designed to trick you into connecting with criminals who will then pressure you for personal details that they can use to commit fraud in your name. Hang up immediately. Real government departments like HMRC will not contact you this way about your National Insurance number. If you've already pressed 1 and spoken to someone, don't panic, but contact your bank immediately to alert them, and report the incident to Action Fraud online or on 0300 123 2040. You may also want to contact CIFAS for protective registration, which adds extra security checks when someone applies for credit using your details. Remember, when you get unexpected calls like this, it's always better to hang up and verify independently.",
