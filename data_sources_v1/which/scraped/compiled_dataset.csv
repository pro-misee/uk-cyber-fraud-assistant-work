What is the Quantum AI scam?
Ads for an AI-fuelled investment scam are circulating on social media again
Tali Ramsey
Last year, Which? exposed a global financial scam called Quantum AI, which impersonated celebs to lure unsuspecting victims into dodgy investment schemes.
Our Which? Tech investigation last year found that
Quantum AI is a global scam
that uses AI to impersonate celebrities and organisations, including the BBC, Elon Musk and David Beckham, to promote an investment scheme.
The scam has reappeared in recent weeks and Which? has found 12 adverts posted on Facebook and Instagram promoting Quantum AI.
Below, we take a look at these dodgy ads and explain how to avoid investment scams.

Quantum AI adverts
A dodgy advert promoting Quantum AI
One of the adverts we came across presented an automation service that claimed to be able to mimic the trading styles of professionals. It promoted this as ‘letting AI handle the market for you’.
We looked into the Facebook page behind the advert, which was recently created and was full of posts advertising the ability to make passive income. It also claimed the business was located in a London-based office building.
The website linked to the advert was registered in the same month and featured links to Telegram and WhatsApp channels.
A dodgy advert promoting Quantum AI
Another advert we discovered used Elon Musk’s image and included fake tweets from Musk promoting the opportunity for Quantum AI users to earn hundreds of euros a day.
The advert prompted you to follow a dodgy link by giving you a short deadline to receive a weekly allowance of €5,000 after investing only €250. We traced the image of Musk used in the advertisement back to several other places on the internet, including its use to advertise other scams.
We found that the ad was posted from a Ukraine-based Facebook account and the posts on the page were unrelated to finance and trading. At the time of writing this, the website linked to the advert was not live. We reported all 12 adverts to Meta using its in-platform reporting tool.
Quantum AI has several websites linked to it, and there are multiple Trustpilot reviews for each of them.
Recent reviewers claimed that the scam impersonated Martin Lewis, Richard Branson, Jeremy Clarkson and Keir Starmer, as well as This Morning, to promote the financial scheme.
Frustrated reviewers also complained of being ‘hounded relentlessly’ by calls from different numbers and not being able to make withdrawals on investments.

key information
How the Quantum AI scam works
You follow an advert on social media promoting Quantum AI. Usually, the image or branding of a famous person or company is used to peddle the scheme.
The advert leads to a website which sometimes impersonates a news organisation, like the BBC, in a fake article promoting the investment scheme.
On the website, you’ll be prompted to enter your personal information in order to be contacted by a ‘financial advisor’. These details may include your name, phone number or email address.
You’ll then be bombarded by phone calls from a ‘financial advisor’ who’ll want to set you up on the Quantum AI platform. You may also receive emails or text messages. Typically, you’ll be asked to initially make an investment of £200-£250.
Spotting scam social media ads
An advert or post on social media may be part of a scam if:
it isn’t posted from an official account but features well-known celebrities or organisations.
it uses deepfakes – you can spot these by looking out for unnatural movements, strange background noises, and unusual details in the hair, lighting and skin tone of the person in videos and images.
it leads to a website that asks for your personal and financial details.
it leads to a website that was recently created – you can find out when a site was created by typing it into the
Who.is website
.
Reporting investment scams
The Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning about Quantum AI, stating that it may be providing or promoting financial services or products without its permission.
It
has a register
that lists financial firms authorised to operate in the UK. It's best to avoid firms that aren't on this list.
On social media, you can report posts by selecting the three dots in the top-right corner of the post and pressing 'report'.
Suspicious websites can be reported to the
National Cyber Security Centre
.
If you've fallen victim to a text scam, you can report it to
Action Fraud
or the police if you live in Scotland.

Watch out for the Nixol diet pill scam
Which? found 62 dodgy adverts appearing on Facebook and Instagram
Tali Ramsey
Numerous ads for Nixol diet pills falsely claim to be endorsed by the TV show, Dragons' Den, Which? warns.
Which? has previously warned about other
dubious ads promoting health claims on social media
after finding examples of fake endorsements and dodgy products conning consumers.
When we looked at Meta's ad library, we found 62 ads claiming to sell Nixol (a weight-loss pill) which either included Dragons' Den logos, were posted from accounts called 'Dragons' Den' or used the image of the well-known Dragon, Deborah Meaden. Many of the ads were also linked to websites impersonating a Daily Mail news story.
Below, we examine two examples of these ads, explain what we found and how you can avoid buying these dodgy products.

A large collection of images displayed on this page are available at
https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/watch-out-for-the-nixol-diet-pill-scam-aIVRx1q4BYP6
Most of the 62 ads that Which? found claimed that Nixol diet pills were endorsed by Dragons' Den. Some ads described the product as a ‘powerful remedy’ and that you could lose ‘12kg in two weeks’.
Other ads claimed that the product was clinically tested by more than 29,000 women and men, is 100% natural and has no side effects.
A advert promoting Nixol supplements using the images of ex-Dragon Sara Davies
Ex-Dragon Sara Davies stated on Facebook that several people had contacted her about weight-loss tablets she supposedly endorsed after seeing ads on social media. She said that any ads which feature her are definitely a scam.
Which? tried to contact Nixol about these ads, but we had no response from its email address. When we tried calling the number on its website, the call didn't connect, and when we looked up its business unit address, it appears to be registered to another company. We contacted the company that occupies the building that Nixol claims to be registered at, and that company confirmed to us that it has no connection to Nixol and had not heard of Nixol before.
Websites impersonating Dragons' Den and the Daily Mail
A website claiming that Nixol has been pitched on TV show Dragon's Den
One of the websites linked to from the ads claimed that Nixol is endorsed by Dragons' Den, and the supposed entrepreneurs pitched the product on the show.
Which? traced the images used on the website to several other places on the internet and found that some were from news articles as well as real people who had lost weight via other methods.
An AI-generated image of the Dragons from Dragon's Den
The website also featured an AI-generated image of the Dragons on Dragons' Den holding boxes of Nixol.
A website impersonated the Daily Mail promoting Nixol
Another recently created website that was linked to from the ads impersonated the Daily Mail. The website was made to look like an article promoting the supplement, claiming it ‘naturally burns fat’ and received the ‘biggest deal in Dragons' Den history.’
This website was registered to the same location in Reykjavik, Iceland, where we also found several scam websites were registered to last year when we unpicked a
global financial scam
.
The websites led to a retail website where you can buy a Nixol for £55 per month. It's likely that buying this will lead to a subscription trap, which is a type of scam we've previously warned about.
On Trustpilot, buyers of Nixol complained of the pills not working, not being able to obtain a refund and coming across the product after seeing a fake Daily Mail report. One reviewer mentioned that a questionnaire they filled out advised them that they were obese, despite having a healthy BMI.
Weight loss medication
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warns against obtaining any weight-loss medicines from any source other than a pharmacy, online or in-store, or through your doctor.
Fake diet pills have been found to contain dangerous and illegal substances.
If you've taken a medicine and are concerned about your health, call 111.
What does Meta say?
We reported all ads to Meta using its in-platform reporting tool.
Which? also contacted Meta about these ads, and it confirmed that it had removed the ads we flagged. However, at the time of writing this, several new ads promoting Nixol had been posted.
Meta also told Which? that under its health and wellness advertising policy, ads must not promote weight-loss products that include side-by-side before and after comparisons, close-ups to specific body areas or reinforce negative or unhealthy body images.
Spotting social media scams
If you come across a social media ad or post that you’re suspicious of, take these steps:
Avoid offers or claims that sound too good to be true
Double-check endorsements
Use a tool like
TinEye
to trace the source of images used in the ad
Use a tool like
who.is
to look up domain name registrations; a recent registration is a good indication that it's a scam website
Don't give out personal or financial information
If you fall victim to a scam, call your bank immediately using the number on the back of your bank card and report it to
Action Fraud
, or call the police on 101 if you’re in Scotland.

How to spot a scam
Ask yourself the following questions. If you answer yes to any of them, there's a good chance it's a scam.
Have you been contacted out of the blue?
Cold calls or unexpected emails or messages should raise suspicion, especially if you’re asked to give personal or payment details. It’s very unusual for legitimate organisations to contact you and ask for sensitive information if you’re not expecting them to. If you're not 100% convinced about the identity of the caller, hang up and contact the company directly.
Have you been asked to share personal details?
Never share your personal details with anyone if you can't confirm they are who they say they are. Scammers will often try and get valuable personal data from you, and they can use this to steal your money, or even to steal your identity. You should also be wary of anyone who asks you to pay in an unusual way, such as through Western Union or by using Cryptocurrency.
Are the contact details vague?
Scam websites often have vague contact details. Remember that legitimate companies will have a place of business, phone number or email address to contact them on. Sometimes scammers also use premium rate numbers (starting ‘09’) to squeeze every penny they can out of you.
Are you being asked to keep it secret?
It's important you can discuss any agreements with your friends, family or advisors as outside perspectives can provide valuable voices of reason. Fraudsters use grooming techniques including isolating you so that you don't tell anyone about the situation you're in and fall deeper into the scam. Asking you to keep quiet is a way to keep you away from the advice and support you need in making a decision.
Is the offer too good to be true?
Scams will often promise high returns for very little financial commitment. They may even say that a deal is too good to miss. Use your common sense, if a deal seems too good to be true, it inevitably is.
Are you being pressured to make a decision?
Fraudsters often try to hurry your decision making. Don’t let anyone make you feel under pressure - it’s OK to take a break and think things through if you’re not sure. It's also a common technique for scammers to use a countdown timer on scam websites to pile on further pressure. Genuine companies should always give you time and space to make an informed decision - anyone who tries to rush you should not be trusted.
Are there spelling and grammar mistakes?
Emails or messages littered with spelling and grammar mistakes are a scam giveaway. Legitimate organisations will rarely, if ever, make spelling or grammatical mistakes in their emails to you because they’ve been put together by professionals and checked before they’re sent.

Report fraud to your bank or payment provider
If you’ve lost money to a scam and you paid with a credit or debit card, or transferred money from your account, tell your bank or payment provider as soon as possible. Reports of fraud should be investigated quickly and all efforts should be made to recover the money if possible.
Read our guide on
how to get your money back from a scam
.
Report the scam to Action Fraud and the police
Action Fraud
is the fraud and cybercrime reporting centre for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It gathers intelligence on scams and passes it onto the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau for analysis by the police.

How to report a scam
Email scams
Report the scam
Scam emails should be forwarded to report@phishing.gov.uk. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) will be able to investigate the scam and may be able to prevent other people from being targeted.
You can also report scam emails to the email provider.
On Gmail, click 'Report spam'. Google will receive a copy of the email and may analyse it.
On Outlook, use the 'Phishing' button and block the sender. This will stop you from getting messages from them in the future.
On Yahoo Mail, click 'Spam' and select a reason for reporting the email.
Inform the company
If you've received a fake email claiming to be from a company, it’s worth alerting the company in question.
This could be a bank, government department, utility provider, a shop or a subscription service.
The company can then warn its customers about the scam and take steps to prevent scammers from targeting it in the future.
Scam calls and texts
To report premium rate phone scams, contact Ofcom by
filling out a form on its website
or by calling it on 0300 123 3333 or 020 7981 3040.
You can report scam calls received on your mobile phone to your provider by texting the word ‘call’ followed by the dubious phone number to 7726 on an iPhone. If you have an Android, text the word ‘call’ to 7726. You’ll then receive a message asking you for the scam number.
You can report scam texts by forwarding the text to 7726.
Scam adverts
If you've seen a dodgy advert, or feel you’ve been misled by one, you can report it to the
Advertising Standards Authority
(ASA).
You can report any kind of mass advertising including ads that appear on television, radio, billboards, websites and social media.
The ASA will investigate and can get scam ads removed. It can also fine companies or individuals that breach its guidelines.
On Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, you can report posts or ads by selecting the three dots in the corner and pressing 'Report'.
Report junk and scam mail
If you receive junk mail that you think might be from fraudsters, you can send it to Royal Mail at: Freepost Royal Mail Customer Services.
Royal Mail provides a
form
that you can use to report scam letters. You can submit this online or send it to Freepost Scam Mail with the letter you received. Reporting scams helps Royal Mail investigate them with the relevant authorities.
Stop scam mail
The Mailing Preference Service (MPS) can remove your name and address from mailing lists. Register for free by calling 020 7291 3310 or visit
mpsonline.org.uk
.
Scam companies
If you report a scam to your local Citizens Advice, it may be able to offer you practical advice.
Citizens Advice has a
strong relationship with Trading Standards
. When you report a business you have concerns about, it will pass on information for officers to look into.
Trading Standards officers investigate companies that may be involved in illegal activities, and have powers to take criminal action against fraudulent firms.
Suspicious websites can be reported to
the National Cyber Security Centre on its website

How did you pay?
How you go about getting your money back, and how successful you’re likely to be, will depend on how the money was paid.
Debit card
If you used a debit card, you may be able to ask your bank to get your money back through the
chargeback scheme
.
Chargeback is not enshrined in law but is part of Scheme Rules, which participating banks subscribe to.
It applies to all debit card transactions including goods costing less than £100, although exact rules may vary between the American Express, Maestro and Visa networks.
But, there are no guarantees your bank will be able to recover the money through chargeback.
Chargeback also applies to credit card transactions where goods cost less than £100, so section 75 doesn’t apply.
If you want to use chargeback to get your money back after a scam,
this letter template could help
.
Bank transfer
A bank transfer scam, also known as an authorised push payment (APP) scam, occurs when you - knowingly or unwittingly - transfer money from your own bank account to one belonging to a scammer.
If you've been caught out by a complex and convincing scam which has resulted in you transferring your money into another bank account, then you should contact your bank immediately.
Tell the bank what happened, and let it know the bank account number your money was sent to.
The bank can try and recover the funds once it has been notified.
The new APP fraud reimbursement requirement came into force on 7 October 2024 and applies to bank transfer scams that happen on or after this date. For bank trasnfer scams before this date, the voluntary Contingent Reimbursement Model applies.
All types of APP fraud are covered by the new system, such as impersonation or romance scams. The rules apply to payment service providers (PSP) that offer Faster Payments, which is most UK banks, building societies and e-money firms.
Read our guide detailed guide to
get your money back after a bank transfer or authorised push payment scam
.
Credit card
If you've paid for goods or services with a credit or debit card, you have greater protection if things go wrong under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act or by using chargeback.
But whether you can make a claim or not depends on the type of scam you have fallen for.
An example of a scam where you could use
Section 75
or
chargeback
would be a scam where you paid for goods or services and it turned out these were either never available or the 'seller' disappeared.
Credit cards have the greatest protection, as you can make a claim against your card provider under Section 75. Under Section 75, the credit card company is jointly and severally liable for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the company.
For Section 75 to apply the item or service you bought must have cost more than £100 and not more than £30,000.
Paypal
Order not delivered
If the scammer took payment for an item through PayPal but failed to send it, you should be covered by PayPal Buyer Protection. However, there are some exceptions and time limits on lodging a claim.
In some cases, scammers set up convincing fake PayPal payment forms which actually just gather your bank details.
Fake PayPal payment page
This is when the scammer has used PayPal branding to make fraudulent activity look legitimate.
As PayPal isn't part of the transaction, you won't be able to claim your money back via PayPal Buyer Protection.
Seller protection
Sellers can be scammed when a fraudster pays for an item via PayPal. The scammer may say that they didn't receive the item and make a claim through PayPal Buyer Protection or
Section 75
.
If you’re caught out by this scam you’ll probably want to make a claim.
But this has conditions and requirements - particularly around the delivery address that's used and the seller having proof of delivery.
As long as you’ve met all of the criteria you should be protected.
In some instances, the scammer will be aware of these rules and will specify a different delivery address or collect in person.
In these scenarios, you wouldn't be covered by seller protection as you didn't meet the condition of posting the item to the account holder’s registered address.
Cash, vouchers or gift cards
Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to get your cash back after a scam.
This is also the case if the scam involved gift cards or vouchers. Make sure you never share the numbers on the back of gift cards or vouchers with people you don't know.
Report the fraud to the police and
Trading Standards
to see if they can take any action.
Talking to others about what's happened, and hearing about the experiences of others who have been through the same experience can help. You can get in touch with support groups through charities such as Citizen's Advice, Victim Support and Age UK.
Money transfer wire service
Unfortunately, it's not always possible to get your money back if you paid via a wire service such as MoneyGram, PayPoint or Western Union.
All of these services provide advice on how to avoid fraud and scams, so it’s a good idea to read their guidance to safeguard yourself against future scams.
I didn't authorise the payment
If there is a transaction on your card that you don't recognise, you can make a claim to your bank.
If you've handed over your card to have a particular amount debited from it, and then you find more money has been taken without your permission, or a sum has been taken by someone else, you can make a claim for this additional amount.
The
Payment Services Regulations
and the Banking Conduct of Business rules place obligations on banks and building societies to provide a refund in these circumstances.
Make sure you report the unauthorised transaction as soon as you become aware of it.

Different banks might have different policies on reimbursing victims of fraud, but all banks have a responsibility to protect your money.

Watch out for the Nixol diet pill scam
Which? found 62 dodgy adverts appearing on Facebook and Instagram
Tali Ramsey
Numerous ads for Nixol diet pills falsely claim to be endorsed by the TV show, Dragons' Den, Which? warns.
Which? has previously warned about other
dubious ads promoting health claims on social media
after finding examples of fake endorsements and dodgy products conning consumers.
When we looked at Meta's ad library, we found 62 ads claiming to sell Nixol (a weight-loss pill) which either included Dragons' Den logos, were posted from accounts called 'Dragons' Den' or used the image of the well-known Dragon, Deborah Meaden. Many of the ads were also linked to websites impersonating a Daily Mail news story.
Below, we examine two examples of these ads, explain what we found and how you can avoid buying these dodgy products.

A large collection of images displayed on this page are available at
https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/watch-out-for-the-nixol-diet-pill-scam-aIVRx1q4BYP6
Most of the 62 ads that Which? found claimed that Nixol diet pills were endorsed by Dragons' Den. Some ads described the product as a ‘powerful remedy’ and that you could lose ‘12kg in two weeks’.
Other ads claimed that the product was clinically tested by more than 29,000 women and men, is 100% natural and has no side effects.
A advert promoting Nixol supplements using the images of ex-Dragon Sara Davies
Ex-Dragon Sara Davies stated on Facebook that several people had contacted her about weight-loss tablets she supposedly endorsed after seeing ads on social media. She said that any ads which feature her are definitely a scam.
Which? tried to contact Nixol about these ads, but we had no response from its email address. When we tried calling the number on its website, the call didn't connect, and when we looked up its business unit address, it appears to be registered to another company. We contacted the company that occupies the building that Nixol claims to be registered at, and that company confirmed to us that it has no connection to Nixol and had not heard of Nixol before.
Websites impersonating Dragons' Den and the Daily Mail
A website claiming that Nixol has been pitched on TV show Dragon's Den
One of the websites linked to from the ads claimed that Nixol is endorsed by Dragons' Den, and the supposed entrepreneurs pitched the product on the show.
Which? traced the images used on the website to several other places on the internet and found that some were from news articles as well as real people who had lost weight via other methods.
An AI-generated image of the Dragons from Dragon's Den
The website also featured an AI-generated image of the Dragons on Dragons' Den holding boxes of Nixol.
A website impersonated the Daily Mail promoting Nixol
Another recently created website that was linked to from the ads impersonated the Daily Mail. The website was made to look like an article promoting the supplement, claiming it ‘naturally burns fat’ and received the ‘biggest deal in Dragons' Den history.’
This website was registered to the same location in Reykjavik, Iceland, where we also found several scam websites were registered to last year when we unpicked a
global financial scam
.
The websites led to a retail website where you can buy a Nixol for £55 per month. It's likely that buying this will lead to a subscription trap, which is a type of scam we've previously warned about.
On Trustpilot, buyers of Nixol complained of the pills not working, not being able to obtain a refund and coming across the product after seeing a fake Daily Mail report. One reviewer mentioned that a questionnaire they filled out advised them that they were obese, despite having a healthy BMI.
Weight loss medication
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warns against obtaining any weight-loss medicines from any source other than a pharmacy, online or in-store, or through your doctor.
Fake diet pills have been found to contain dangerous and illegal substances.
If you've taken a medicine and are concerned about your health, call 111.
What does Meta say?
We reported all ads to Meta using its in-platform reporting tool.
Which? also contacted Meta about these ads, and it confirmed that it had removed the ads we flagged. However, at the time of writing this, several new ads promoting Nixol had been posted.
Meta also told Which? that under its health and wellness advertising policy, ads must not promote weight-loss products that include side-by-side before and after comparisons, close-ups to specific body areas or reinforce negative or unhealthy body images.
Spotting social media scams
If you come across a social media ad or post that you’re suspicious of, take these steps:
Avoid offers or claims that sound too good to be true
Double-check endorsements
Use a tool like
TinEye
to trace the source of images used in the ad
Use a tool like
who.is
to look up domain name registrations; a recent registration is a good indication that it's a scam website
Don't give out personal or financial information
If you fall victim to a scam, call your bank immediately using the number on the back of your bank card and report it to
Action Fraud
, or call the police on 101 if you’re in Scotland.

What is the Quantum AI scam?
Ads for an AI-fuelled investment scam are circulating on social media again
Tali Ramsey
Last year, Which? exposed a global financial scam called Quantum AI, which impersonated celebs to lure unsuspecting victims into dodgy investment schemes.
Our Which? Tech investigation last year found that
Quantum AI is a global scam
that uses AI to impersonate celebrities and organisations, including the BBC, Elon Musk and David Beckham, to promote an investment scheme.
The scam has reappeared in recent weeks and Which? has found 12 adverts posted on Facebook and Instagram promoting Quantum AI.
Below, we take a look at these dodgy ads and explain how to avoid investment scams.

Quantum AI adverts
A dodgy advert promoting Quantum AI
One of the adverts we came across presented an automation service that claimed to be able to mimic the trading styles of professionals. It promoted this as ‘letting AI handle the market for you’.
We looked into the Facebook page behind the advert, which was recently created and was full of posts advertising the ability to make passive income. It also claimed the business was located in a London-based office building.
The website linked to the advert was registered in the same month and featured links to Telegram and WhatsApp channels.
A dodgy advert promoting Quantum AI
Another advert we discovered used Elon Musk’s image and included fake tweets from Musk promoting the opportunity for Quantum AI users to earn hundreds of euros a day.
The advert prompted you to follow a dodgy link by giving you a short deadline to receive a weekly allowance of €5,000 after investing only €250. We traced the image of Musk used in the advertisement back to several other places on the internet, including its use to advertise other scams.
We found that the ad was posted from a Ukraine-based Facebook account and the posts on the page were unrelated to finance and trading. At the time of writing this, the website linked to the advert was not live. We reported all 12 adverts to Meta using its in-platform reporting tool.
Quantum AI has several websites linked to it, and there are multiple Trustpilot reviews for each of them.
Recent reviewers claimed that the scam impersonated Martin Lewis, Richard Branson, Jeremy Clarkson and Keir Starmer, as well as This Morning, to promote the financial scheme.
Frustrated reviewers also complained of being ‘hounded relentlessly’ by calls from different numbers and not being able to make withdrawals on investments.

key information
How the Quantum AI scam works
You follow an advert on social media promoting Quantum AI. Usually, the image or branding of a famous person or company is used to peddle the scheme.
The advert leads to a website which sometimes impersonates a news organisation, like the BBC, in a fake article promoting the investment scheme.
On the website, you’ll be prompted to enter your personal information in order to be contacted by a ‘financial advisor’. These details may include your name, phone number or email address.
You’ll then be bombarded by phone calls from a ‘financial advisor’ who’ll want to set you up on the Quantum AI platform. You may also receive emails or text messages. Typically, you’ll be asked to initially make an investment of £200-£250.
Spotting scam social media ads
An advert or post on social media may be part of a scam if:
it isn’t posted from an official account but features well-known celebrities or organisations.
it uses deepfakes – you can spot these by looking out for unnatural movements, strange background noises, and unusual details in the hair, lighting and skin tone of the person in videos and images.
it leads to a website that asks for your personal and financial details.
it leads to a website that was recently created – you can find out when a site was created by typing it into the
Who.is website
.
Reporting investment scams
The Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning about Quantum AI, stating that it may be providing or promoting financial services or products without its permission.
It
has a register
that lists financial firms authorised to operate in the UK. It's best to avoid firms that aren't on this list.
On social media, you can report posts by selecting the three dots in the top-right corner of the post and pressing 'report'.
Suspicious websites can be reported to the
National Cyber Security Centre
.
If you've fallen victim to a text scam, you can report it to
Action Fraud
or the police if you live in Scotland.
