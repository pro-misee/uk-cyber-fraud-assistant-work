    "output": "You are right to be suspicious of the Quantum AI investment scheme. Which? has exposed this as a global scam that uses AI to impersonate celebrities and organizations, including the BBC, Elon Musk, and David Beckham, to promote a fraudulent investment scheme. The scam has reappeared recently with adverts circulating on Facebook and Instagram. These adverts often promise high returns, use fake testimonials, and pressure you to invest quickly. You should not invest any money in this scheme. Instead, you should report any such adverts to the social media platform where you saw them and to Action Fraud. By being aware of these tactics, you can protect yourself from falling victim to such sophisticated scams.",
