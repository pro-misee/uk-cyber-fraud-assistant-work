    "output": "If you used your debit card to pay for something that turned out to be a scam, you may be able to get your money back through the chargeback scheme. Chargeback is not a legal requirement, but it is a scheme that most banks subscribe to. You should contact your bank as soon as possible to report the scam and ask them to start the chargeback process. There are no guarantees that you will get your money back, but it is definitely worth trying. You can use the Which? template letter to help you with your claim.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "This is known as an authorised push payment (APP) scam, and it can be very distressing. The first thing you should do is contact your bank immediately. They can try to recover the funds from the scammer's account. You should also report the scam to Action Fraud. A new reimbursement requirement for APP scams came into force on 7 October 2024, which means that you are more likely to get your money back if you are a victim of this type of scam. However, it is still important to act quickly and to report the scam to your bank and to Action Fraud.",
