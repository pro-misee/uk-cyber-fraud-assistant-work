    "instruction": "How can I avoid investment scams?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "To avoid investment scams, you should be wary of any unsolicited offers, especially those that promise high returns with little or no risk. You should also be suspicious of any company that pressures you to make a quick decision, or that asks you to pay in an unusual way, such as with a cryptocurrency or a gift card. Before you invest any money, you should do your own research and check that the company is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). You can also get independent financial advice from a qualified professional. By being cautious and doing your research, you can protect yourself from investment scams and make informed decisions about your money.",
