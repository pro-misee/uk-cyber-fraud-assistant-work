    "output": "You're right to be cautious about unexpected emails asking for personal information. A key sign of a scam is being contacted out of the blue. Legitimate organizations will rarely ask for sensitive information without you expecting them to. You should also be wary of any email that creates a sense of urgency, or that asks you to pay in an unusual way, such as with cryptocurrency. If you are not 100% sure about the identity of the sender, do not click on any links or download any attachments. Instead, you should contact the company directly using the contact details on their official website. By being vigilant, you can protect yourself from phishing scams and keep your personal information safe.",

    "output": "It's great that you're being proactive about protecting yourself from scams. A good rule of thumb is to be suspicious of any unexpected contact, whether it's a phone call, email, or text message.

If you are ever unsure about something, you should talk to a friend or family member about it. Scammers often try to isolate their victims, so getting a second opinion can be very helpful.
