Warning signs
Early pension release scams
Pension review scams
Protect yourself from pension scams
Report a pension scam
Pension scams often involve attractive offers that aim to persuade you to transfer your pension pot (or release funds from it).
If you’re worried about money and want to use your pension to repay debts, contact a free debt adviser first to find out what your options are.
Use
MoneyHelper’s debt advice locator tool
to find free debt advice near you.
Warning signs
Pension scams often include:
a guaranteed better return on your pension savings
high-pressure sales tactics
unusual investments, which tend to be unregulated and high risk
complicated structures, so it isn’t clear where your money will end up
several groups (some of which may be based overseas) all taking a fee, which means the total amount deducted from your pension is significant
Early pension release scams
You should be very wary of any scheme offering to help you release cash from your pension before you’re 55. It’s almost certainly a scam.
Generally,
you can only take money from your pension when you’re 55 or older
except in certain cases, such as poor health. This will increase to 57 from 2028.
How early pension release scams work
Offers to access your pension early may be called 'pension liberation' or a 'pension loan', as the scammers often claim you can borrow money from your pension fund.
If you take up the offer, your pension funds will be transferred into a scheme set up by the scam, which will often be based abroad.
You may be 'loaned' an amount (often around half of your pension), with the company involved taking a fee, perhaps as much as 30%.
You could also face a tax bill of 55% on what you withdraw, even if:
you didn’t realise you’d broken the tax rules
you put the money back in your pension
you’ve paid fees or charges to the company involved
you’ve spent all the money
Once you’ve paid the fees and tax, any money remaining will then be invested in high-risk products or projects, like overseas property developments.
Sometimes it’s simply stolen outright.
Risks of accessing your pension early
Taking cash from your pension before you’re 55 is unlikely to be in your interests.
If an FCA-authorised adviser recommends an early pension-release scheme, ask them to explain the full consequences and risks, and your other options.
These schemes can be illegal if you’re not told – or are misled – about the tax you’ll pay and the risks of accessing your pension early.
MoneyHelper has more information about
taking your pension
and
ill-health retirement
. If you’re over 50, you can also book a free appointment with a
Pension Wise adviser
.
Pension review scams
If you’re contacted unexpectedly and offered a free pension review, it’s likely to be a scam.
Professional advice on pensions is not free
.
Most of the companies offering free pension reviews aren’t authorised, but many falsely claim they are. They may also claim that they don’t have to be authorised, as they aren’t providing the advice themselves.
Some scammers may even say they’re acting on behalf of the FCA or
MoneyHelper
.
How pension review scams work
Free pension reviews are designed to persuade you to move money from your pension pot into a high-risk scheme.
Your pension pot is then invested in unusual investments such as overseas property, forestry, storage units, care homes, biofuels or businesses you may not be familiar with.
You may be promised guaranteed returns or cash from your pension to tempt you to take up these offers.
Some of these investments are badly run, while others are outright scams.
As they’re promoted as long-term pension investments, it could be several years before you realise something is wrong.
Protect yourself from pension scams
If you get a call out of the blue (a cold call) about your pension, the safest thing to do is hang up. It’s illegal and probably a scam. If you get offers via email or text, you should simply ignore them.
Report pension cold calls to the
Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
.
If you’re thinking about changing your pension arrangements, you should get financial guidance or advice beforehand.
If you want to find an adviser, make sure they’re authorised by us. Never take advice from the company that contacted you, this may be part of the scam.
Find out more about
getting financial advice
from MoneyHelper.

Common financial scams
What to do if you’ve been scammed
Beware of scammers pretending to be from the FCA. We’d never ask you to transfer money to us and we’d never ask for your bank account PINs and passwords. Find out
how to spot fake FCA communications
, the tactics scammers use, and methods of contact.
Spot the warning signs
Scams can be difficult to spot. Fraudsters can be convincing and knowledgeable, with websites and materials that look identical to the real thing.
But if you’ve been contacted unexpectedly, or are suspicious about a call or text message, make sure you stop and check the warnings signs.
Is it unexpected?
Scammers often call out of the blue. They may also try and contact you via email, text, post, social media, or even in person.
Do you feel pressured to act quickly?
Scammers might offer you a bonus or discount if you invest quickly, or they may say the opportunity is only available for a short time.
Does the offer sound too good to be true?
Fraudsters often promise tempting rewards, such as high returns on an investment.
Is the offer exclusively for you?
Scammers might claim that you’ve been specially chosen for an investment opportunity, and it should be kept a secret.
Are they trying to flatter you?
Scammers often try to build a friendship with you to put you at ease.
Are you feeling worried or excited?
Fraudsters may try to influence your emotions to get you to act.
Are they speaking with authority?
Scammers might claim that they’re authorised and often appear knowledgeable about financial products.
If you answered ‘yes’ to any of these questions, or you’re unsure if a contact is genuine, follow the steps below to protect yourself.
Check the firm
1
Use the FCA Firm Checker
Almost all financial services firms in the UK must be authorised or registered by us. To find out if a firm or individual is authorised, you can search the
Firm Checker
.
https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/fca-firm-checker
Check that the firm reference number (FRN) and contact details you've been given match the details on the Firm Checker.
If there aren't any contact details listed on the Firm Checker, or the firm says they're out of date, call us on 0800 111 6768.
Remember, some firms
pretend to be authorised firms
, so always use the contact details on the Firm Checker.
Always use the website address above to visit the Firm Checker. Never click on links in emails or on company websites. It could be part of the scam.
2
Contact us
If you're struggling to check the details of a financial firm or individual, find out how to
contact us
.
Our team can check the details you've been given and tell you if the firm is genuine.
How to protect yourself
Do:
Treat all unexpected calls, emails and text messages with caution. Don’t assume they’re genuine, even if the person knows some basic information about you.
Hang up on calls and ignore messages if you feel pressured to act quickly. A genuine bank or business won’t mind waiting if you want time to think.
Check your bank account and credit card statements regularly.
Consider getting independent financial advice or guidance before a big financial decision (MoneyHelper has information on
how to find a financial adviser
).
Check overseas regulators if you’re dealing with an overseas firm (you should also check the list of
scam warnings from overseas regulators
).
Don’t:
Give out your bank account or credit card details unless you’re certain who you’re dealing with.
Share your passwords with anyone (including your social media passwords).
Give access to your device by downloading software or an app from a source you don’t trust. Scammers may be able to take control of your device and access your bank account.
Common financial scams
These common financial scams each have their own warning signs to watch out for.

Carbon credit trading scams
Cryptoasset investment scams

gold
graphene
hotels
international forestry
land for development
land overseas
overseas agriculture
parking
precious metals
storage
student accommodation
sustainable energy
UK forestry

But even if the offer isn’t a scam, you should still be cautious about investing in any products we don’t regulate. If you do, you won’t be protected if something goes wrong and you could lose all your money.
If you're contacted unexpectedly about an investment opportunity, use our
Investment Checker
to avoid scams.
What to do if you’ve been scammed
Report it
If you’re worried about a potential scam, or you think you may have been contacted by a fraudster, report it to us. This could help prevent others falling victim to the same criminal.
Call us on
0800 111 6768
or use our
contact form
to get in touch.
For anything we don’t regulate, or if you’ve lost money to a scam, contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or
via their website
.
Be wary of future scams
It’s important to be extra careful if you’ve already been scammed. Fraudsters could try and target you again, or they may sell your details to other criminals.
The new scam might be completely different, or it could be related to the previous scam. For example, you could be contacted with an offer to get your money back or to buy back an investment after you pay a fee. These are known as recovery room scams.
If you have any concerns at all about a potential financial scam,
contact us immediately

How loan fee fraud works
How to protect yourself
How genuine loan fees work
Report a scam
Loan fee fraud or advance fee fraud is a common scam where individuals are conned into paying a fee for a loan.
The fraudsters often ask for between £25 and £450. But once the fee is paid, you’ll never receive the loan you were offered.
If you’re struggling with money, you can get guidance on
dealing with debt from MoneyHelper
. You can also use the
Debt Advice Locator tool
to find free services in your area.
How loan fee fraud works
Scammers will often try to target individuals who’ve applied for loans online. They may contact you unexpectedly and will offer you the money you need.
But before giving you the loan, they’ll ask for an upfront payment as a deposit, administrative fee or insurance. They might claim it’s because you have a bad credit history.
They’ll often put pressure on you to pay the fee quickly via a bank transfer. Or they may ask you to buy a voucher, for example from Google Play, Amazon or Ebay. Scammers have even started asking for payments to be made via crypto exchanges.
The fraudsters may say the fee is refundable. But even though you make the payments they ask for, you’ll never receive the loan – or a refund on the fee.
How to protect yourself
If you need to apply for a loan, you should only deal with authorised firms. If you don’t, you won’t be protected if things go wrong, and you could end up losing lots of money.
Use the
FCA Firm Checker
to make sure a financial firm is authorised by us and has our permission to provide the service you’re looking for.
Check that the firm’s contact details match the details on the Firm Checker.
Always use the contact details on the Firm Checker, rather than a direct line or email you've been given.
If there are no contact details on the Firm Checker, or the firm says they’re out of date, call us on 0800 111 6768.
How genuine loan fees work
Sometimes, genuine authorised firms will ask you to pay an upfront fee before they’ll provide a loan. If they do, they must send you a notice setting out specific information.
Before you get the loan, you’ll need to reply to the notice, saying you understand and agree with what it says.
The notice should include:
The name of the firm as it appears on the Firm Checker.
A statement that the firm is acting as a credit broker.
A statement saying if you need to pay a charge for the firm’s services.
The amount of the charge (or how it will be calculated).
When the firm will take payment from you and how you'll pay.

How to protect yourself
Common financial scams
What to do if you’ve been scammed
Beware of scammers pretending to be from the FCA. We’d never ask you to transfer money to us and we’d never ask for your bank account PINs and passwords. Find out
how to spot fake FCA communications
, the tactics scammers use, and methods of contact.
Spot the warning signs
Scams can be difficult to spot. Fraudsters can be convincing and knowledgeable, with websites and materials that look identical to the real thing.
But if you’ve been contacted unexpectedly, or are suspicious about a call or text message, make sure you stop and check the warnings signs.
Is it unexpected?
Scammers often call out of the blue. They may also try and contact you via email, text, post, social media, or even in person.
Do you feel pressured to act quickly?
Scammers might offer you a bonus or discount if you invest quickly, or they may say the opportunity is only available for a short time.
Does the offer sound too good to be true?
Fraudsters often promise tempting rewards, such as high returns on an investment.
Is the offer exclusively for you?
Scammers might claim that you’ve been specially chosen for an investment opportunity, and it should be kept a secret.
Are they trying to flatter you?
Scammers often try to build a friendship with you to put you at ease.
Are you feeling worried or excited?
Fraudsters may try to influence your emotions to get you to act.
Are they speaking with authority?
Scammers might claim that they’re authorised and often appear knowledgeable about financial products.
If you answered ‘yes’ to any of these questions, or you’re unsure if a contact is genuine, follow the steps below to protect yourself.
Check the firm
1
Use the FCA Firm Checker
Almost all financial services firms in the UK must be authorised or registered by us. To find out if a firm or individual is authorised, you can search the
Firm Checker
.
https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/fca-firm-checker
Check that the firm reference number (FRN) and contact details you've been given match the details on the Firm Checker.
If there aren't any contact details listed on the Firm Checker, or the firm says they're out of date, call us on 0800 111 6768.
Remember, some firms
pretend to be authorised firms
, so always use the contact details on the Firm Checker.
Always use the website address above to visit the Firm Checker. Never click on links in emails or on company websites. It could be part of the scam.
2
Contact us
If you're struggling to check the details of a financial firm or individual, find out how to
contact us
.
Our team can check the details you've been given and tell you if the firm is genuine.
How to protect yourself
Do:
Treat all unexpected calls, emails and text messages with caution. Don’t assume they’re genuine, even if the person knows some basic information about you.
Hang up on calls and ignore messages if you feel pressured to act quickly. A genuine bank or business won’t mind waiting if you want time to think.
Check your bank account and credit card statements regularly.
Consider getting independent financial advice or guidance before a big financial decision (MoneyHelper has information on
how to find a financial adviser
).
Check overseas regulators if you’re dealing with an overseas firm (you should also check the list of
scam warnings from overseas regulators
).
Don’t:
Give out your bank account or credit card details unless you’re certain who you’re dealing with.
Share your passwords with anyone (including your social media passwords).
Give access to your device by downloading software or an app from a source you don’t trust. Scammers may be able to take control of your device and access your bank account.
Common financial scams

fine art
gold
graphene
hotels
international forestry
land for development
land overseas
overseas agriculture
parking
precious metals
storage
student accommodation
sustainable energy
UK forestry
whisky/whiskey
wine
But even if the offer isn’t a scam, you should still be cautious about investing in any products we don’t regulate. If you do, you won’t be protected if something goes wrong and you could lose all your money.
If you're contacted unexpectedly about an investment opportunity, use our
Investment Checker
to avoid scams.
What to do if you’ve been scammed
Report it
If you’re worried about a potential scam, or you think you may have been contacted by a fraudster, report it to us. This could help prevent others falling victim to the same criminal.
Call us on
0800 111 6768
or use our
contact form
to get in touch.
For anything we don’t regulate, or if you’ve lost money to a scam, contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or
via their website
.
Be wary of future scams
It’s important to be extra careful if you’ve already been scammed. Fraudsters could try and target you again, or they may sell your details to other criminals.
The new scam might be completely different, or it could be related to the previous scam. For example, you could be contacted with an offer to get your money back or to buy back an investment after you pay a fee. These are known as recovery room scams.
If you have any concerns at all about a potential financial scam,
contact us immediately

Warning signs
Early pension release scams
Pension review scams
Protect yourself from pension scams
Report a pension scam
Pension scams often involve attractive offers that aim to persuade you to transfer your pension pot (or release funds from it).
If you’re worried about money and want to use your pension to repay debts, contact a free debt adviser first to find out what your options are.
Use
MoneyHelper’s debt advice locator tool
to find free debt advice near you.
Warning signs
Pension scams often include:
a guaranteed better return on your pension savings
high-pressure sales tactics
unusual investments, which tend to be unregulated and high risk
complicated structures, so it isn’t clear where your money will end up
several groups (some of which may be based overseas) all taking a fee, which means the total amount deducted from your pension is significant
Early pension release scams
You should be very wary of any scheme offering to help you release cash from your pension before you’re 55. It’s almost certainly a scam.
Generally,
you can only take money from your pension when you’re 55 or older
except in certain cases, such as poor health. This will increase to 57 from 2028.
How early pension release scams work
Offers to access your pension early may be called 'pension liberation' or a 'pension loan', as the scammers often claim you can borrow money from your pension fund.
If you take up the offer, your pension funds will be transferred into a scheme set up by the scam, which will often be based abroad.
You may be 'loaned' an amount (often around half of your pension), with the company involved taking a fee, perhaps as much as 30%.
You could also face a tax bill of 55% on what you withdraw, even if:
you didn’t realise you’d broken the tax rules
you put the money back in your pension
you’ve paid fees or charges to the company involved
you’ve spent all the money
Once you’ve paid the fees and tax, any money remaining will then be invested in high-risk products or projects, like overseas property developments.
Sometimes it’s simply stolen outright.
Risks of accessing your pension early
Taking cash from your pension before you’re 55 is unlikely to be in your interests.
If an FCA-authorised adviser recommends an early pension-release scheme, ask them to explain the full consequences and risks, and your other options.
These schemes can be illegal if you’re not told – or are misled – about the tax you’ll pay and the risks of accessing your pension early.
MoneyHelper has more information about
taking your pension
and
ill-health retirement
. If you’re over 50, you can also book a free appointment with a
Pension Wise adviser
.
Pension review scams
If you’re contacted unexpectedly and offered a free pension review, it’s likely to be a scam.
Professional advice on pensions is not free
.
Most of the companies offering free pension reviews aren’t authorised, but many falsely claim they are. They may also claim that they don’t have to be authorised, as they aren’t providing the advice themselves.
Some scammers may even say they’re acting on behalf of the FCA or
MoneyHelper
.
How pension review scams work
Free pension reviews are designed to persuade you to move money from your pension pot into a high-risk scheme.
Your pension pot is then invested in unusual investments such as overseas property, forestry, storage units, care homes, biofuels or businesses you may not be familiar with.
You may be promised guaranteed returns or cash from your pension to tempt you to take up these offers.
Some of these investments are badly run, while others are outright scams.
As they’re promoted as long-term pension investments, it could be several years before you realise something is wrong.
Protect yourself from pension scams
If you get a call out of the blue (a cold call) about your pension, the safest thing to do is hang up. It’s illegal and probably a scam. If you get offers via email or text, you should simply ignore them.
Report pension cold calls to the
Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
.
If you’re thinking about changing your pension arrangements, you should get financial guidance or advice beforehand.
If you want to find an adviser, make sure they’re authorised by us. Never take advice from the company that contacted you, this may be part of the scam.
Find out more about
getting financial advice
from MoneyHelper.

What are screen sharing scams
How to protect yourself
If you've been scammed
What are screen sharing scams
A screen sharing scam is the method someone might use to take information from you or access your accounts to transfer your money. You may be contacted out of the blue through social media or over the phone. Or when searching online for an investment opportunity or the contact details for a company.
Once a scammer has contacted you, they will try and gain your trust and convince you they can help. The type of scams may vary, whether that’s help with an investment or a banking service, the scammer will typically ask you to download legitimate screen sharing software.
This could be software you have heard of or have used before with work, friends or family. This could be software such as AnyDesk, Microsoft Teams, TeamViewer or Zoom. It could be through your phone, laptop or computer.
The scam can only take place if you download the software and allow them to take control of your screen. Once they have access to your screen, they can access your personal information. This includes any financial accounts, such as your online banking.
One of the main warning signs of a potential scam is if a firm or individual contacts you out of the blue. If you're asked to share your screen or provide remote access to your phone or computer, this is a warning sign it's a scam.
How to protect yourself
Even if you have searched for a company online and contacted the firm, you should never share your screen with them. Scammers may try to build trust, friendship or a sense of security with you. Be wary of being put under pressure to make any decisions. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
You should only deal with financial services firms that are authorised by us. Use the
FCA Firm Checker
to find out if a firm is authorised and has permission for the service it's offering you. If you can't find a firm on the Firm Checker,
contact us
on 0800 111 6768.
Always be wary if you’re contacted out of the blue, pressured to invest quickly or promised returns that sound too good to be true.
If you're contacted unexpectedly by a financial business, make sure you only reply using the contact details on the
Firm Checker
.
Always check the
FCA Warning List
before dealing with a company, to find out if they are known to be operating without our authorisation.
Find out more about how to
protect yourself from scams
.
You should seriously consider getting financial advice or guidance before investing. MoneyHelper has information on
how to find a financial adviser
and our
InvestSmart
pages will help you make better investment decisions.
If you've been scammed
If you’re worried about a potential scam, or you think you may have been contacted by a fraudster, report it to us. Call us on 0800 111 6768 or use our
contact form
.
If you’ve already invested in a scam, fraudsters may try and target you again or sell your details to other criminals.
The follow-up scam may be completely separate or related to the previous fraud, such as an
offer to get your money back
or to buy back the investment after you pay a fee.
