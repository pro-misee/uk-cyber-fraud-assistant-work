    "content":"Don\u2019t let a scammer enjoy your retirement. Find out how pension scams work, how to avoid them, and what to do if you suspect a scam.\nFirst published:\n10\/08\/2017\nLast updated:\n20\/03\/2023\nSee all updates\nOn this page\nWarning signs\nEarly pension release scams\nPension review scams\nProtect yourself from pension scams\nReport a pension scam\nPension scams often involve attractive offers that aim to persuade you to transfer your pension pot (or release funds from it).\nIf you\u2019re worried about money and want to use your pension to repay debts, contact a free debt adviser first to find out what your options are.\nUse\nMoneyHelper\u2019s debt advice locator tool\nto find free debt advice near you.\nWarning signs\nPension scams often include:\na guaranteed better return on your pension savings\nhigh-pressure sales tactics\nunusual investments, which tend to be unregulated and high risk\ncomplicated structures, so it isn\u2019t clear where your money will end up\nseveral groups (some of which may be based overseas) all taking a fee, which means the total amount deducted from your pension is significant\nEarly pension release scams\nYou should be very wary of any scheme offering to help you release cash from your pension before you\u2019re 55. It\u2019s almost certainly a scam.\nGenerally,\nyou can only take money from your pension when you\u2019re 55 or older\nexcept in certain cases, such as poor health. This will increase to 57 from 2028.\nHow early pension release scams work\nOffers to access your pension early may be called 'pension liberation' or a 'pension loan', as the scammers often claim you can borrow money from your pension fund.\nIf you take up the offer, your pension funds will be transferred into a scheme set up by the scam, which will often be based abroad.\nYou may be 'loaned' an amount (often around half of your pension), with the company involved taking a fee, perhaps as much as 30%.\nYou could also face a tax bill of 55% on what you withdraw, even if:\nyou didn\u2019t realise you\u2019d broken the tax rules\nyou put the money back in your pension\nyou\u2019ve paid fees or charges to the company involved\nyou\u2019ve spent all\u202fthe money\nOnce you\u2019ve paid the fees and tax, any money remaining will then be invested in high-risk products or projects, like overseas property developments.\nSometimes it\u2019s simply stolen outright.\nRisks of accessing your pension early\nTaking cash from your pension before you\u2019re 55 is unlikely to be in your interests.\nIf an FCA-authorised adviser recommends an early pension-release scheme, ask them to explain the full consequences and risks, and your other options.\nThese schemes can be illegal if you\u2019re not told \u2013 or are misled \u2013 about the tax you\u2019ll pay and the risks of accessing your pension early.\nMoneyHelper has more information about\ntaking your pension\nand\nill-health retirement\n. If you\u2019re over 50, you can also book a free appointment with a\nPension Wise adviser\n.\nPension review scams\nIf you\u2019re contacted unexpectedly and offered a free pension review, it\u2019s likely to be a scam.\nProfessional advice on pensions is not free\n.\nMost of the companies offering free pension reviews aren\u2019t authorised, but many falsely claim they are. They may also claim that they don\u2019t have to be authorised, as they aren\u2019t providing the advice themselves.\nSome scammers may even say they\u2019re acting on behalf of the FCA or\nMoneyHelper\n.\nHow pension review scams work\nFree pension reviews are designed to persuade you to move money from your pension pot into a high-risk scheme.\nYour pension pot is then invested in unusual investments such as overseas property, forestry, storage units, care homes, biofuels or businesses you may not be familiar with.\nYou may be promised guaranteed returns or cash from your pension to tempt you to take up these offers.\nSome of these investments are badly run, while others are outright scams.\nAs they\u2019re promoted as long-term pension investments, it could be several years before you realise something is wrong.\nProtect yourself from pension scams\nIf you get a call out of the blue (a cold call) about your pension, the safest thing to do is hang up. It\u2019s illegal and probably a scam. If you get offers via email or text, you should simply ignore them.\nReport pension cold calls to the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO)\n.\nIf you\u2019re thinking about changing your pension arrangements, you should get financial guidance or advice\u202fbeforehand.\nIf you want to find an adviser, make sure they\u2019re authorised by us. Never take advice from the company that contacted you, this may be part of the scam.\nFind out more about\ngetting financial advice\nfrom MoneyHelper.\nReport a pension scam\nIf you\u2019re worried about a potential scam or you think you may have been contacted by a fraudster, report it to us.\nCall us\u202fon 0800 111 6768 or use our\ncontact form\nto get in touch.\nPage updates\n20\/03\/2023\n:\nEditorial amendment\npage update as part of website refresh\nWas this page useful?\nYes\nNo\nWhat can we do to improve pages like this?\nWhat did you find helpful?\nSubmit Feedback\nLeave this field blank",

    "content":"Every year we receive hundreds of reports of loan fee fraud, with victims reporting an average loss of \u00a3255. Find out how to spot the warning signs.\nFirst published:\n18\/04\/2016\nLast updated:\n23\/04\/2025\nSee all updates\nOn this page\nHow loan fee fraud works\nHow to protect yourself\nHow genuine loan fees work\nReport a scam\nLoan fee fraud or advance fee fraud is a common scam where individuals are conned into paying a fee for a loan.\nThe fraudsters often ask for between \u00a325 and \u00a3450. But once the fee is paid, you\u2019ll never receive the loan you were offered.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with money, you can get guidance on\ndealing with debt from MoneyHelper\n. You can also use the\nDebt Advice Locator tool\nto find free services in your area.\nHow loan fee fraud works\nScammers will often try to target individuals who\u2019ve applied for loans online. They may contact you unexpectedly and will offer you the money you need.\nBut before giving you the loan, they\u2019ll ask for an upfront payment as a deposit, administrative fee or insurance. They might claim it\u2019s because you have a bad credit history.\nThey\u2019ll often put pressure on you to pay the fee quickly via a bank transfer. Or they may ask you to buy a voucher, for example from Google Play, Amazon or Ebay. Scammers have even started asking for payments to be made via crypto exchanges.\nThe fraudsters may say the fee is refundable. But even though you make the payments they ask for, you\u2019ll never receive the loan \u2013 or a refund on the fee.\nHow to protect yourself\nIf you need to apply for a loan, you should only deal with authorised firms. If you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t be protected if things go wrong, and you could end up losing lots of money.\nUse the\nFCA Firm Checker\nto make sure a financial firm is authorised by us and has our permission to provide the service you\u2019re looking for.\nCheck that the firm\u2019s contact details match the details on the Firm Checker.\nAlways use the contact details on the Firm Checker, rather than a direct line or email you've been given.\nIf there are no contact details on the Firm Checker, or the firm says they\u2019re out of date, call us on 0800 111 6768.\nHow genuine loan fees work\nSometimes, genuine authorised firms will ask you to pay an upfront fee before they\u2019ll provide a loan. If they do, they must send you a notice setting out specific information.\nBefore you get the loan, you\u2019ll need to reply to the notice, saying you understand and agree with what it says.\nThe notice should include:\nThe name of the firm as it appears on the Firm Checker.\nA statement that the firm is acting as a credit broker.\nA statement saying if you need to pay a charge for the firm\u2019s services.\nThe amount of the charge (or how it will be calculated).\nWhen the firm will take payment from you and how you'll pay.\nReport a scam\nIf you\u2019re worried about a potential scam, or you think you may have been contacted by a fraudster, report it to us.\nCall us on 0800 111 6768 or use our\ncontact form\nto get in touch.\nPage updates\n23\/04\/2025\n:\nInformation added\non the FCA Firm Checker.\n06\/12\/2023\n:\nEditorial amendment\n20\/03\/2023\n:\nEditorial amendment\nPage update as part of the website refresh\n14\/12\/2022\n:\nInformation changed\nAverage loss figure updated.\n10\/05\/2022\n:\nInformation added\nQuick links near the start of the page\n09\/12\/2021\n:\nInformation added\nAnti-fraud jingle video added\n11\/08\/2021\n:\nInformation changed\nMoney Advice Service to MoneyHelper\n17\/11\/2020\n:\nEditorial amendment\nHouse style updates\nWas this page useful?\nYes\nNo\nWhat can we do to improve pages like this?\nWhat did you find helpful?\nSubmit Feedback\nLeave this field blank",

Find out how to spot the warning signs.\nFirst published:\n18\/04\/2016\nLast updated:\n23\/04\/2025\nSee all updates\nOn this page\nHow loan fee fraud works\nHow to protect yourself\nHow genuine loan fees work\nReport a scam\nLoan fee fraud or advance fee fraud is a common scam where individuals are conned into paying a fee for a loan.\nThe fraudsters often ask for between \u00a325 and \u00a3450. But once the fee is paid, you\u2019ll never receive the loan you were offered.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with money, you can get guidance on\ndealing with debt from MoneyHelper\n. You can also use the\nDebt Advice Locator tool\nto find free services in your area.\nHow loan fee fraud works\nScammers will often try to target individuals who\u2019ve applied for loans online. They may contact you unexpectedly and will offer you the money you need.\nBut before giving you the loan, they\u2019ll ask for an upfront payment as a deposit, administrative fee or insurance. They might claim it\u2019s because you have a bad credit history.\nThey\u2019ll often put pressure on you to pay the fee quickly via a bank transfer. Or they may ask you to buy a voucher, for example from Google Play, Amazon or Ebay. Scammers have even started asking for payments to be made via crypto exchanges.\nThe fraudsters may say the fee is refundable. But even though you make the payments they ask for, you\u2019ll never receive the loan \u2013 or a refund on the fee.\nHow to protect yourself\nIf you need to apply for a loan, you should only deal with authorised firms. If you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t be protected if things go wrong, and you could end up losing lots of money.\nUse the\nFCA Firm Checker\nto make sure a financial firm is authorised by us and has our permission to provide the service you\u2019re looking for.\nCheck that the firm\u2019s contact details match the details on the Firm Checker.\nAlways use the contact details on the Firm Checker, rather than a direct line or email you've been given.\nIf there are no contact details on the Firm Checker, or the firm says they\u2019re out of date, call us on 0800 111 6768.\nHow genuine loan fees work\nSometimes, genuine authorised firms will ask you to pay an upfront fee before they\u2019ll provide a loan. If they do, they must send you a notice setting out specific information.\nBefore you get the loan, you\u2019ll need to reply to the notice, saying you understand and agree with what it says.\nThe notice should include:\nThe name of the firm as it appears on the Firm Checker.\nA statement that the firm is acting as a credit broker.\nA statement saying if you need to pay a charge for the firm\u2019s services.\nThe amount of the charge (or how it will be calculated).\nWhen the firm will take payment from you and how you'll pay.\nReport a scam\nIf you\u2019re worried about a potential scam, or you think you may have been contacted by a fraudster, report it to us.\nCall us on 0800 111 6768 or use our\ncontact form\nto get in touch.\nPage updates\n23\/04\/2025\n:\nInformation added\non the FCA Firm Checker.\n06\/12\/2023\n:\nEditorial amendment\n20\/03\/2023\n:\nEditorial amendment\nPage update as part of the website refresh\n14\/12\/2022\n:\nInformation changed\nAverage loss figure updated.\n10\/05\/2022\n:\nInformation added\nQuick links near the start of the page\n09\/12\/2021\n:\nInformation added\nAnti-fraud jingle video added\n11\/08\/2021\n:\nInformation changed\nMoney Advice Service to MoneyHelper\n17\/11\/2020\n:\nEditorial amendment\nHouse style updates\nWas this page useful?\nYes\nNo\nWhat can we do to improve pages like this?\nWhat did you find helpful?\nSubmit Feedback\nLeave this field blank",

It\u2019s almost certainly a scam.\nGenerally,\nyou can only take money from your pension when you\u2019re 55 or older\nexcept in certain cases, such as poor health. This will increase to 57 from 2028.\nHow early pension release scams work\nOffers to access your pension early may be called 'pension liberation' or a 'pension loan', as the scammers often claim you can borrow money from your pension fund.\nIf you take up the offer, your pension funds will be transferred into a scheme set up by the scam, which will often be based abroad.\nYou may be 'loaned' an amount (often around half of your pension), with the company involved taking a fee, perhaps as much as 30%.\nYou could also face a tax bill of 55% on what you withdraw, even if:\nyou didn\u2019t realise you\u2019d broken the tax rules\nyou put the money back in your pension\nyou\u2019ve paid fees or charges to the company involved\nyou\u2019ve spent all\u202fthe money\nOnce you\u2019ve paid the fees and tax, any money remaining will then be invested in high-risk products or projects, like overseas property developments.\nSometimes it\u2019s simply stolen outright.\nRisks of accessing your pension early\nTaking cash from your pension before you\u2019re 55 is unlikely to be in your interests.\nIf an FCA-authorised adviser recommends an early pension-release scheme, ask them to explain the full consequences and risks, and your other options.\nThese schemes can be illegal if you\u2019re not told \u2013 or are misled \u2013 about the tax you\u2019ll pay and the risks of accessing your pension early.\nMoneyHelper has more information about\ntaking your pension\nand\nill-health retirement\n. If you\u2019re over 50, you can also book a free appointment with a\nPension Wise adviser\n.\nPension review scams\nIf you\u2019re contacted unexpectedly and offered a free pension review, it\u2019s likely to be a scam.\nProfessional advice on pensions is not free\n.\nMost of the companies offering free pension reviews aren\u2019t authorised, but many falsely claim they are. They may also claim that they don\u2019t have to be authorised, as they aren\u2019t providing the advice themselves.\nSome scammers may even say they\u2019re acting on behalf of the FCA or\nMoneyHelper\n.\nHow pension review scams work\nFree pension reviews are designed to persuade you to move money from your pension pot into a high-risk scheme.\nYour pension pot is then invested in unusual investments such as overseas property, forestry, storage units, care homes, biofuels or businesses you may not be familiar with.\nYou may be promised guaranteed returns or cash from your pension to tempt you to take up these offers.\nSome of these investments are badly run, while others are outright scams.\nAs they\u2019re promoted as long-term pension investments, it could be several years before you realise something is wrong.\nProtect yourself from pension scams\nIf you get a call out of the blue (a cold call) about your pension, the safest thing to do is hang up. It\u2019s illegal and probably a scam. If you get offers via email or text, you should simply ignore them.\nReport pension cold calls to the\nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO)\n.\nIf you\u2019re thinking about changing your pension arrangements, you should get financial guidance or advice\u202fbeforehand.\nIf you want to find an adviser, make sure they\u2019re authorised by us.

You may be contacted out of the blue through social media or over the phone. Or when searching online for an investment opportunity or the contact details for a company.\nOnce a scammer has contacted you, they will try and gain your trust and convince you they can help. The type of scams may vary, whether that\u2019s help with an investment or a banking service, the scammer will typically ask you to download legitimate screen sharing software.\nThis could be software you have heard of or have used before with work, friends or family. This could be software such as AnyDesk, Microsoft Teams, TeamViewer or Zoom. It could be through your phone, laptop or computer.\nThe scam can only take place if you download the software and allow them to take control of your screen. Once they have access to your screen, they can access your personal information. This includes any financial accounts, such as your online banking.\nOne of the main warning signs of a potential scam is if a firm or individual contacts you out of the blue. If you're asked to share your screen or provide remote access to your phone or computer, this is a warning sign it's a scam.\nHow to protect yourself\nEven if you have searched for a company online and contacted the firm, you should never share your screen with them. Scammers may try to build trust, friendship or a sense of security with you. Be wary of being put under pressure to make any decisions.
