The FCA has a Financial Services Register that you can use to check if a firm is authorized and has the right permissions to offer the services they are providing. You can search the register for both firms and individuals. If a firm is not on the register, it is not authorized by the FCA and you should not deal with them. You should also be wary of firms that contact you out of the blue, or that pressure you to make a quick decision.
