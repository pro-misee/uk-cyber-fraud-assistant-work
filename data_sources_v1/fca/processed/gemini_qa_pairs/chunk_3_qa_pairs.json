    "output": "You should be very wary of any company that asks you to pay an upfront fee for a loan. This is a common scam known as loan fee fraud. Legitimate lenders will not ask you to pay a fee in advance. Scammers often target people who have been searching for loans online, and they may pressure you to pay the fee quickly. They may also ask you to pay the fee in an unusual way, such as with a voucher or through a crypto exchange. If you pay the fee, you will not receive the loan, and you will not get your money back. If you need a loan, you should only deal with firms that are authorized by the FCA. You can check the FCA's Financial Services Register to see if a firm is authorized.",
