    "output": "It's important to be able to spot fake communications from the FCA, as scammers may try to impersonate them. The FCA will never ask you to transfer money to them, and they will never ask for your bank account PINs or passwords. If you receive an email, text message, or phone call that you are not sure about, you should not reply or click on any links. Instead, you should contact the FCA directly using the contact details on their website. You can also check the FCA's website for information on the latest scams and how to spot fake communications. By being vigilant, you can protect yourself from scammers who may be pretending to be from the FCA.",

    "output": "You should be very cautious if you are contacted unexpectedly about an investment opportunity. This is a common tactic used by scammers. You should never feel pressured to make a quick decision, and you should be wary of any offer that sounds too good to be true. Before you invest any money, you should check the FCA's Financial Services Register to make sure that the firm is authorized. You can also use the FCA's ScamSmart website to get more information about how to avoid investment scams. If you are unsure about an investment, you should seek independent financial advice from a qualified professional.
