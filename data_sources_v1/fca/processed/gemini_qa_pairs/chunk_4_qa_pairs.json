    "input": "",
    "output": "Financial scams can be very sophisticated, but there are some common warning signs to look out for. Be wary of anyone who contacts you unexpectedly, or who pressures you to make a quick decision. Scammers often promise high returns on an investment, or they may offer you a bonus or discount if you invest quickly. They may also claim that the opportunity is only available for a short time, or that it is an exclusive offer just for you. Scammers may also try to build a friendship with you to put you at ease, or they may try to influence your emotions to get you to act. If you notice any of these warning signs, you should be very suspicious and should not proceed with the investment.",
