    "input": "",
    "output": "It sounds like you may have been a victim of loan fee fraud, which is a type of advance fee fraud. It's understandable to feel concerned, but there are steps you can take. First, you should know that legitimate lenders will not ask for an upfront fee to secure a loan. If you've already paid, it's important to cease any further contact with the company and do not provide any more money. You should report the incident to Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime. You can also contact the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to check if the company is authorized and to report the scam. Remember to keep all records of your communications with the company, as this will be helpful for your report.",

You should also be cautious about sharing personal information, such as your address or financial details. If you're unsure about someone, you can do a reverse image search to see if their photos have been used elsewhere. Trust your instincts, and if something feels wrong, it probably is. Remember that genuine relationships are built on trust and mutual respect, not on financial transactions.",
