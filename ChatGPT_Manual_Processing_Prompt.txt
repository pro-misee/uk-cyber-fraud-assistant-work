CHATGPT PROMPT FOR MANUAL SCRAPED CONTENT PROCESSING
===================================================

STEP 1: CONTEXT SETUP
=====================

I'm expanding a UK cyber fraud AI assistant dataset. I'll provide JSON data containing UK fraud articles.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

**STANDALONE QUESTIONS ONLY**: Every question must make complete sense without referencing "this source", "the article", "this campaign", "according to this data", etc. 

**INDIVIDUAL SCENARIO FOCUS**: Generate realistic victim scenarios alongside factual questions. 50% should be individual scenarios like "I received...", "Someone told me...", "My parent got a call..."

**CYBER FRAUD CONTENT ONLY**: Only create Q&A pairs from cyber fraud content. Skip general crime statistics, government policy, or non-fraud material.

**DOCUMENT GROUNDING**: ALL answers must be directly supported by the source content. Do NOT add external knowledge.

Your task: Generate 20-30 UNIQUE Q&A pairs covering:
- Individual victim scenarios (50%): realistic situations people face
- Factual questions (30%): definitions, statistics, procedures  
- Prevention/guidance (20%): warning signs, protective measures

AVOID:
- References to source material ("according to this article", "this source says")
- Generic responses not grounded in the document
- Non-fraud content from government announcements

STEP 2: ARTICLE PROCESSING
==========================

Generate 20-30+ Q&A pairs using this FRAMEWORK:

**QUESTION TYPES:**

1. **INDIVIDUAL SCENARIOS (50%)**:
   - "I received a text saying my bank account is frozen, what should I do?"
   - "Someone called claiming to be from HMRC demanding immediate payment, is this legitimate?"
   - "My elderly parent got a call about computer problems, how can I help them?"
   - "I'm selling online and received a QR code to 'verify my account', should I scan it?"

2. **FACTUAL/DEFINITIONAL (30%)**:
   - "What is quishing and how does it work?"
   - "How much money was lost to QR code scams in the UK last year?"
   - "Which contact number should I use to report extortion emails?"

3. **PREVENTION/GUIDANCE (20%)**:
   - "What are the warning signs of a fraudulent QR code?"
   - "How can I safely pay for parking if the QR code looks suspicious?"

**TONE**: Professional, empathetic, UK-specific with correct contact information (101, 159, report@phishing.gov.uk, 7726), British English.

**REQUIRED JSON FORMAT:**
CRITICAL: Use straight double quotes (") not curly quotes (" "). Include trailing commas between objects.

```json
[
  {
    "instruction": "I received an email demanding Bitcoin payment and claiming to have videos of me, what should I do?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Do not engage with the sender or pay anything. Forward the email to report@phishing.gov.uk (SERS) and then delete it. If the email includes a password you still use, change it immediately and enable additional authentication factors. These are typically extortion scams using data from historic breaches to appear authentic. If you fear someone may actually possess intimate images, call 101 to report to your local police.",
    "source_document": "[exact title from JSON]",
    "source_url": "[exact URL from JSON]",
    "chunk_number": 1,
    "document_index": 1,
    "generated_by": "chatgpt",
    "scam_category": "sextortion",
    "target_demographic": "general",
    "threat_level": "high"
  }
]
```

**STANDALONE EXAMPLES:**

❌ BAD: "What does this source say about QR code safety?"
✅ GOOD: "I scanned a QR code for parking and now I'm worried it was fake, what should I do?"

❌ BAD: "According to the article, how should I report fraud?"
✅ GOOD: "How do I report a fraudulent email in the UK?"

STEP 3: QUALITY CONTROL
=======================

1. Can each question be understood without additional context?
2. Do questions avoid phrases like "this source", "the article"?
3. Are scenarios realistic and specific?
4. Is every answer grounded in the provided document content?
5. Mix of scenarios (50%) and factual questions (50%)?
6. UK-specific guidance with correct contact details?

Revise any questions that aren't standalone and provide the final diverse JSON.

TARGET: 20-30+ diverse, standalone Q&A pairs covering cyber fraud content with realistic scenarios and factual accuracy.
