  "content": "Cyber Essentials\nCyber security is high on UK Financeâ€™s agenda, which is why we are part of the government-backed Cyber Essentials initiative alongside our other cyber defences.\nThe landscape for cyber security is constantly changing at pace and remains a key area of focus for businesses of all sizes and from all sectors.\nWhat is Cyber Essentials?\nCyber Essentials is a simple but effective scheme that helps organisations, from SMEs to large companies, to protect themselves from the most common cyber attacks. Cyber attacks vastly vary in their scale and approach, but the majority are basic in nature and are carried out by unskilled individuals.\nThe Cyber Essentials scheme provides advice aimed at preventing these basic cyber attacks. Making a commitment to Cyber Essentials demonstrates an organisation's commitment to cyber security. UK Finance is delighted to be part of Cyber Essentials.\nHow does Cyber Essentials work?\nOrganisations can choose the level of commitment they wish to make. The most basic level is for an organisation to familiarise themselves with cyber security terminology.\nA self-assessment option will provide peace of mind as most common cyber attacks target websites that do not have the Cyber Essentials technical controls in place.\nThe Cyber Essentials Plus certificate requires a more extensive review and proves that an organisation's cyber security has been independently reviewed and verified.\nWhat is UK Finance's commitment?\nUK Finance is proud to hold the advanced Cyber Essentials Plus certificate. Becoming certified demonstrates to our members that we have secured our IT estate against cyber attacks, and aligns with our wider policy aims.",
