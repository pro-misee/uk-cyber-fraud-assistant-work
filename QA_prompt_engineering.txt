I have a JSON file (compiled_dataset.json) containing UK cyber fraud prevention content. I need you to:

ðŸ”¹ Tasks
Auto-split the dataset into chunks of 2â€“3 documents each

Generate 3â€“5+ Q&A pairs per document within each chunk

Save each chunk's output as a separate file in data_sources/[source_name]/processed/gemini_qa_pairs/

Create a final combined file (final_combined_qa_pairs.json) with all Q&A pairs

ðŸ”¹ Chunking Instructions
Read the full compiled_dataset.json

Automatically group every 2â€“3 documents into a chunk

Process each chunk individually for higher Q&A quality

Save outputs as:

bash
Copy
Edit
data_sources/[source_name]/processed/gemini_qa_pairs/
â”œâ”€â”€ chunk_1_qa_pairs.json
â”œâ”€â”€ chunk_2_qa_pairs.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
ðŸ”¹ Q&A Generation Guidelines
Questions (written from a victimâ€™s perspective and based only on that chunk's content):

"I think Iâ€™ve been scammed â€” what should I do?"

"Someone asked for my bank details. Is this legit?"

"I clicked a suspicious link â€” what now?"

"How can I recognize [specific threat]?"

Answers should be:

Empathetic, supportive, and informative

Strictly grounded in the source document

Use second-person ("you") language

100â€“300 words long

Include specific resources (e.g. helplines, URLs) if present in source

Focused on cyber fraud, phishing, identity theft, and digital security

ðŸ”¹ Output Format per Chunk
Each chunk file should be a valid JSON array:
```json
[
  {
    "instruction": "Victim-focused question?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Empathetic, comprehensive answer...",
    "source_document": "Document title",
    "source_url": "Document URL",
    "chunk_number": 1,
    "document_index": 1,
    "generated_by": "gemini"
  }
]
```

ðŸ”¹ Final Combined File Format
The final_combined_qa_pairs.json must be ONE valid JSON array containing ALL Q&A pairs:
```json
[
  { "instruction": "...", "input": "", "output": "...", ... },
  { "instruction": "...", "input": "", "output": "...", ... },
  ...
]
```
ðŸ”¹ Final Step
**IMPORTANT**: Compile ALL Q&A pairs from all chunks into a SINGLE JSON array and save as final_combined_qa_pairs.json. The file must contain one valid JSON array with all Q&A pairs combined - do NOT create multiple separate arrays.

ðŸ”¹ Start Instruction
Please read the compiled_dataset.json from the appropriate data_sources/[source_name]/scraped/ directory and carry out the above steps automatically.
