EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:

[
  {
    "instruction": "I got a call from someone claiming to be from my bank asking for my PIN number. They knew some of my details already. Should I have given it to them?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "No, you should never give your PIN to anyone, even if they claim to be from your bank. Legitimate banks will never ask for your PIN, full password, or card details over the phone. The fact that they knew some of your details doesn't make them genuine - scammers often have access to leaked data or use social engineering to gather information. You did the right thing by being cautious. I'd recommend contacting your bank directly using the number on the back of your card to report this incident. You should also report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. If you did share any information, contact your bank immediately to secure your account. Remember, it's always better to hang up and call back on a verified number if you're unsure about any call.",
    "source_document": "Banking security guidance from FCA consumer protection",
    "source_url": "https://example-source-url.com",

TARGET: Generate 40-100 Q&A pairs that comprehensively cover all fraud-related content in the provided document chunk. Focus on creating diverse, realistic victim scenarios while maintaining UK-specific accuracy and empathetic support. Make an extra json file in the processed folder with the summary of the total QA pairs generated.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Do not repeat Questions. Each Q&A pair must make complete standalone sense. A person reading any individual Q&A should fully understand both the question and answer without needing any additional context from other pairs or documents. Ensure questions are specific enough and answers are comprehensive enough to be independently useful.
