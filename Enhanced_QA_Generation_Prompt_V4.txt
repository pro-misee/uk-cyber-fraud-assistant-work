EXAMPLE V4 OUTPUT:

[
  {
    "instruction": "I think someone used AI to clone my mum's voice and called me asking for money. The voice sounded exactly like her, but when I called her back, she said she never called. What should I do?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "I'm so sorry this happened to you - voice cloning scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated and can be extremely convincing. You were absolutely right to verify by calling your mum back directly. This is a new type of AI-enabled fraud where criminals use voice samples (often from social media videos) to create convincing fake calls. First, report this to Action Fraud immediately on 0300 123 2040 or online at actionfraud.police.uk - they're tracking these AI scams specifically. If you sent any money, contact your bank straight away as you may be eligible for reimbursement under new authorised push payment protections. For future protection, establish a family code word for emergency calls, limit voice content on social media, and remember that genuine emergencies would involve official channels. The NCSC also has guidance on protecting against AI-enabled fraud. Please don't feel embarrassed - these scams are designed to exploit our natural care for family, and the technology is so advanced that anyone could be fooled.",

  {
    "instruction": "Someone on Instagram claiming to be an artist wants to use my photo as inspiration for a portrait and is asking for my personal details. Is this the 'muse scam' I've heard about?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "Yes, this sounds exactly like the 'muse scam' that's become very common on Instagram and other social media platforms. Legitimate artists don't typically contact random people asking for personal details to create portraits. This scam usually leads to identity theft, advance fee fraud, or attempts to get you to pay for 'professional photos' or 'portfolio development'. Never share personal information, photos, or payment details with unsolicited contacts claiming to be artists. Check their profile thoroughly - genuine artists have extensive portfolios, verified followers, and professional websites. Report this profile to Instagram using their scam reporting feature, and if they've asked for payment or personal details, report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. Be particularly wary if they're asking for photos in specific poses, payment for 'materials', or offering large sums for 'modelling'. Trust your instincts - if something feels off, it usually is. The fact that you questioned it shows good awareness of these modern social media scams.",
